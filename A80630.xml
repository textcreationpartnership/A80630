            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Commandement thus given, was accordingly performed by all the ſeven Angels, in this whole Chapter.</p>

And whoſe can that be, but his, that hath power over all theſe Plagues, even God himſelfe, and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who alſo have power in the Temple: It is not the voyce of one of the foure Beaſts, the Officers of the Church alone, but a further power doth concur with this voice, ſuch as carried Majeſtie, and authority with it.</p>
            <p>

Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be meant of the common ſort of godly Chriſtians; but though ſome ſoare plagues might befall ſome of them, yet how can the wrath of God be conceived to be powred upon them?

For the opening of this difficulty (which elſe might exerciſe ſome) we muſt know, that in this Prophecie ſometimes <hi>[earth]</hi> is oppoſed to Heaven, and then as by Heaven is meant the pure Church, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.1. So by Earth is meant an earthly and corrupt Church. Sometimes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156636:5"/> alſo by <hi>Heaven</hi> is meant, a corrupt ſtate of Religion, wherein heavenly and divine honour is given to Satan, or Idols, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.3.7. Againe, ſometimes <hi>Earth</hi> is oppoſed not unto <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> but unto ſome other Element in the World, and ſo is it in this Chap. <hi>The firſt Angel poureth forth his Viall upon the Earth, the ſecond poureth his Viall on the Sea, &amp;c.</hi> So then in this caſe, the <hi>Earth</hi> is to be underſtood in a double ſenſe.

And in the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World they have ſome things that repreſent the <hi>Earth,</hi> and ſome things the <hi>Sea,</hi> and ſome things repreſent the <hi>Sunne</hi> of that World, and ſome things repreſent that <hi>Ayre</hi> of that world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the particular execution of this Commiſſion, <hi>When the firſt Angel poureth out his Viall upon the Earth,</hi> it is upon the loweſt and baſeſt Element in the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> world, and that can bee no other, but the loweſt ſort of vulgar Catholiks, and they were the firſt that had the wrath of God pour'd upon them, which did afterwards ariſe higher to the Sea, and then to the Fountaines and Rivers of water, then to the Sunne, then to the throne of the Beaſt, then to the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and laſt of all to the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and in all theſe doth the wrath of God aſcend higher and higher, as may afterwards more clearely appeare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt Angel went and poure out his Viall upon the earth.]</hi> This firſt <hi>Angel</hi> muſt be theſe firſt ſort of Gods Meſſengers, that did poure out ſome wrath upon Common Catholikes. And doubtleſſe ſuch wrath it was, as being poured out, did worke a <hi>Noyſome and grievous ſore upon them that worſhipped the Beaſt, and his Image</hi> (as the Text expreſſeth) <hi>They that had the Mark of the Beaſt</hi> (you heard before out of the 13. Chapt.) are ſuch as receive ſome indeliable Character of the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> ſuch are their Secular, or Regular Prieſts, and all that receive religious Orders from the Church of Rome. Who then are they that worſhip his Image? <hi>The Jmage of the firſt Beaſt</hi> (you know) is all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, and Dioceſan, and Provinciall Churches; and they that rule them are the Image of the ſecond <hi>Beaſt:</hi> So then they that worſhip the Image of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> be ſuch as are devoted to the Canons of Popiſh Churches, who drink them up, and receive them as Articles of their Faith; theſe are all afflicted with a noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and grievous ſore by the pouring out of this firſt Viall: For thoſe who did poure it out, they were ſuch as did convince them of the Damnable eſtate of a Catholike, and taught them, that by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156636:5"/> their Religion they could go not beyond a Reprobate; and this was the common practiſe of the Martyrs of <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and in <hi>Henry</hi> the eight's time, who diſcovered unto you, that all their Religion was but the worſhip of God after the deviſes of men, even Will-worſhip, ſuch as they were led into by the Man of Sinne, who being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe blinde, leadeth thoſe that are blinde, and both fall into the ditch; thoſe that thus diſcovered the unſoundneſſe of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Catholikes, who before ſeemed to be good Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and good Houſe-keepers, and good Chriſtmas-keepers, they were the men that poured out this firſt Viall upon the earth. And upon this their diſcovery, there fell a noyſome, and grieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſore upon their <hi>Catholike Prieſts,</hi> who had borne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort in hand, <hi>That Ignorance was the mother of Devotion, and ſuch ignorant Devotion was the way of Salvation,</hi> when they ſee that all their People, who were heretofore their honeſt and good Neighbours, full of benevolence towards them, were now informed, that they lay under a ſtate of deepe <hi>Damnation,</hi> it was an eye-ſore to their <hi>Catholike Prieſts,</hi> and all of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Order, a double ſore fell upon them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a ſore of envy, and malice, againſt all the Martyrs of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt, and all that ſought for Reformation of Religion; againſt whom their ſpirits were ſo ſtrongly embittered, that happy was he that could bring Fire and Faggot to execute vengeance upon them, that did diſcover the ſtate of the common ſort of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to be ſo dangerous. [It was a publike ſpeech of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, when he ſate in Parliament, Complaining of the ſtirs that were made about Religion, There are many (ſaith he) that are too buſie with their new <hi>(Sumpſimus)</hi> meaning thoſe that clave to that which he counted the new Religion, though withall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he taxed, who doated (as he ſaid not amiſſe) much upon their old <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, there was a noyſome loathſomeneſſe diſcovered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by theſe true Witneſſes, and Martyrs of Chriſt, unto the people. Whereby they began to ſee that the common ſort of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orders were full of <hi>Idleneſſe,</hi> of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> of <hi>Covetouſnes,</hi> of <hi>Pride,</hi> and of <hi>Hypocryſie,</hi> and that they had laid ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Religion, as was not <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the true Foundation, but had indeed reared up an Antichriſtian Religion, whereof (as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156636:6"/> it is ſaid (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.19.) it ſhall be a vexation to heare the Report. A grievous malignant ulcer it was, and the more they ſtirred in it, the more they were vexed. And this let me further adde, for open ng the words, it is an alluſion to that noyſome ſore of <hi>Egypt</hi> that fell upon the Common ſort of the people, and upon the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians</hi> alſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.11. So that they could not ſtand before <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſo it was here, theſe noiſome ſores of which wee have ſpoken, did ſo fall upon the common ſort of Catholikes, and upon their common Religious Orders, that they fell before the Angell that poured out this Viall, as <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Arke. Thus you ſee meaning of theſe words.</p>
            <p>Now for the Notes that ariſe from them.—You may obſerve that (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15 7.) <hi>One of the foure Beaſts gave unto the ſeven Angels, Seven golden Viols full of the wrath of God, but they went not then, to poure them out, untill they heare a great voice out of the Temple, and now they goe.</hi> So that the Doctrine in the firſt place to be obſerved, is this.</p>

Theſe Angels had councell and encouragement given them (as you have heard) to goe about this worke, and were furniſhed with the wrath of God for this ende: but were not effectually ſtirred up to fall upon the execution thereof, till they heare a great Voice of Chriſt out of the Temple, (that is in publike Ordinances) then they goe to poure out their Vials. You ſhall find this a very ordinary Practiſe in ſome things ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereunto in Scripture. <hi>Iſaack</hi> gave <hi>Iacob</hi> a Commandement and Inſtruction to goe to <hi>Padan-Aram, Gen.</hi> 28 6.

Private Revelations without the Word, are out of date, but certaine it is, that God doth ſpeake by his Spirit in private Meditation and Prayers, and conferences with Bretheren; and in all theſe, comforteth his people with the manifeſtation of his fatherly goodneſſe, yet ſpeaketh nothing, but in his word, and according to it.

            <p>That God in his Iudgements vpon wicked perſons, and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> ſtates beginneth firſt with the leaſt and loweſt amongſt them, this is evident in the Text, firſt upon the earth, and the ſea is next; which like the naturall ſea is above the earth, and the Rivers, and fountaines are higher then it, and the ſunne higher then they: and then vpon the throne of the Beaſt, and when we come to open the ſequell you ſhall ſee that all things goe in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; And in this ſort did the Lord deale when hee brought antichriſt into the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.7. The firſt judgement came vpon the earth; The ſecond vpon the ſea; The third vpon the rivers and fountaines of water; The fourth vpon the Sunne, then commeth Antichriſt the King of the Bottomeleſſe pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.11. and here in the 5.

And the conſideration yeeldeth great light to helpe us in the expoſition of theſe ſeven vials: for by the ſame ſteps wherby antichriſt came into the world, by the ſame ſteps doth the Lord vndermine him and bring him downe. For as firſt the common ſort of Chriſtians were corrupted when antichriſt was brought in, ſo firſt the Common ſort of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques are blaſted, when antichriſt beginneth to fall: The like courſe did the Lord take in the plagues of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 7.19. &amp;c. He beginneth with the loweſt, firſt to turne their waters into bloud, and thereby killeth their fiſh, but ſtill men ſubſiſt well enough, but then he bringeth frogs into all the land of Egypt, and they crawle into their kneading troughes, then he changeth the duſt of the land into lice, and that was a great deale

            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon of Gods dealing thus, is to magnifie Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> vnto all; knoweſt thou not that the long ſuffering of God leadeth thee to Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.

            <p>This may ſerve in the firſt place to teach all men in the feare of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> God, to become wiſe by light Iudgements and gentle afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thoſe which you would thinke may leaſt of all concerne you ſleight them not: nothing more diſtant, from the chiefe men in a State, then the common multitude. A Iudgement upon them doth not matter much, if a Famine were upon the common ſort of people, Princes and Great men would not be much affected therewith. But the leaſt of his judgements ſhould be warnings unto us, to teach us that the Lord hath taken his Sword into his hand, and will go on in judgement, untill he make the ſoules of men to tremble. What if a judgement begin upon mens cattell? That is farre off: It will come next upon your Servants and Children, and it may be, reach to the wife of your boſome; and if all this prevaile not, it may be, He will ſtrike you with grievous

What will the heart of a poore Creature doe in ſuch a caſe? O conſider this all ye that forget God! leaſt hee teare you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. When the Lord ſtriketh aloofe from us, It is but the Viall of the firſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, but when the Lord beginneth, he will go on further; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be the wiſdome of the ſonnes of men to take heed of his ſtroakes afarre off.

Be we warned therefore by the firſt hints of chaſtiſements, by ſmall and gentle viſitations, and happy they that learne to profit by ſuch, to turne unto God, and to make their peace with him, before his wrath breake forth like a devouring fire, and there be none to quench it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Verſe deſcribes the pouring out of the Viall of the ſecond Angel: For the ſubject, <hi>He poures it on the Sea;</hi> and the effect was, <hi>the Sea became as the blood of a Dead man,</hi> and the effect of that, <hi>on the living ſoules in the Sea, they all dyed.</hi> The alluſion is, to a like plague upon <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the 7. of <hi>Exod.</hi> 20 21.

            <p>Now for the meaning of this ſecond Viall. Firſt, for the <hi>Sea,</hi> What is heere meant by the Sea? And what by the Sea becomming blood, <hi>and as the blood of a dead man?</hi> And how is every living ſoule in this Sea, ſaid to dye by this means? The Sea cannot be meant the ordinary Sea of waters, for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring any judgement on that ſea, that can afflict Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:156636:12"/> more then Chriſtians; if you ſhould corrupt all the Sea (as the Papiſts expound it, and yet they beleeve all theſe evils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to Antichriſt.) What hurt will it be to Antichriſt more then to the Church of Chriſt? If all the fiſh in the ſea died, What would it hurt <hi>Antichriſt</hi> more then Chriſtian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? cannot <hi>Antichriſt</hi> be ſupplyed with other dainties on the ſhore, out of the Flocks and Heards, and out of the Fields and Woods, and out of the Ayre from the Fowles there, though he never had any Fiſh at his Table? That therefore cannot bee the meaning. But the ſea is the ſea of the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> world, a diſtinct world from that heavenly ſtate wherein other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches ſtand. The Sea, as you know, is the confluence of all the Rivers and Fountaines of waters; they all finally are gathered together into one place, and are called Sea. And truly the confluence &amp; concourſe of all the ſprings of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they do meet together in one Religion, that is the common receptacle of all; <hi>All my freſh ſprings are in the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 87.7. In that Religion which the Church profeſſeth: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Religion was reſembled in the 4 of the <hi>Revel. verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>By the ſea of Glaſſe like unto Chryſtall,</hi> that is, all the Ordinances of God they were ſo cleare, as that you n ight ſee Chriſts face in them as in a mirrour or glaſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p>Wherein the ſtate of Religion in the New Teſtament diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the ſtate of Religion in the old Teſtament, Where the Brazen ſea in <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple was indeed bright as braſſe, but thicke and not tranſparent, you could not ſee ſo clearly the blood of Chriſt in it; and yet there was a ſea of Waters: What to doe? In the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.2. to the end of the 6. <hi>verſe,</hi> which was for the Prieſts to waſh in. Now what is it that can cleanſe the Prieſts, but onely the blood of the Lord Ieſus. Now that was reſembled by the water in the Brazen ſea. Therefore all the Ordinances of Chriſt, which did hold forth the blood of Chriſt, to the waſhing and purging of the Prieſts and people of God, that is the ſea. Now this ſea, as you heard in the 15. Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the 2. <hi>verſe,</hi> In the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches is a ſea of Glaſſe, though mingled with Fire; mingled with ſome contention, yet the face of Chriſt might be cleerely ſeene in it. But this ſea heere, that is, the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is the confluence of all their Ordinances, as they doe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:156636:12"/> the worſhip of God: And upon this ſea, upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is the ſecond Viall poured. In the former Viall, Firſt, men ſtumbled at the lives of Papiſts, and therupon at the lives of them that led them, at their Prieſts covetouſneſſe, ignorance, and hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, they liked not their lives, though at firſt they ſtumbled not at their religion, but thought it was the fault of their lives; but ſoone after, they ſtumble at their Religion; ſo that the next Vial is poured on their Religion, the Ordinances themſelves, as they are diſpenced by them: the Viall is poured on them ſo farre as they differ from Reformed Churches. Then what? This being the ſea, how is this ſea come to be as bloud? That is this Religion of theirs is convinced, and diſcovered to be, not ſuch as holds forth the cleanſing blood of the Lord Ieſus, as the Sea in <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Temple</hi> did: and as the ſea of Glaſſe like unto <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall</hi> did, but holds forth <hi>the blood of a dead man:</hi> A dead Chriſt, and dead Ordinances to any ſpirituall life. There is no life, no power, no ſavour of goodneſſe in it; <hi>as the blood of a dead man,</hi> which is not like the living blood of Chriſt, to cleanſe and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and to give life; <hi>Whoſoever eats my fleſh; and drinks my bloud hath eternall life, John</hi> 6.54 But this is the blood not of the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, but of a dead man, there is the beſt of it, and what is that? Fit to pollute and defile, fit to choake a man, but not to feed him; not to cleanſe and purge him. <hi>And every thing living in that ſea dyed:</hi> Every thing, That is every ſoule that had no other life, but what was bred and fed in that Religion; and had no other Chriſtian life but what he ſucked and derived from that Religion, they all periſhed everlaſtingly, this is the meaning of the words of the Text.</p>
            <p>Now then it may be further demanded for clearing of this meaning, who is this Angell that poures out this viall of Gods wrath on this ſea? the ſea (you ſay) is Antichriſtian religion, for the firſt began with the earth; this goes up higher, and ſo higher, and higher, till it come to the throne, and till at length <hi>Babilon</hi> be fallen: So that all theſe plagues fall on the antichriſtian ſtate. But who is this Angell that poureth out this Viall? There be ſome conceive that they are they who met in the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and gathered all the ſtreames of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh prieſts, and their doctrine, and practiſe, and ratified them all in that Councell; yea ſome thinke that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:156636:13"/> done the Church of God good ſervice, in gathering the body of Controverſies, betweene proteſtants and popiſh Churches, and hath delivered them in ſo many volumes that you might have a whole ſea of antichriſtian doctrine, worſhip, and governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by him confirmed, though I doe not diſlike the notion, and it will fall into the true meaning, yet that holds not cloſe to the letter of the Text, for the Text makes all the Angels to be ſuch as come out of reformed Churches,<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 15 5.6.</note> the Temple open in heaven; members of reformed Churches, all cloathed in pure and white linnen, godly Chriſtians, righteous ſoules, and girded with golden girdles, ſtabliſhed in the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, therefore they cannot be the Biſhops, and Doctors of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Bellarmine</hi> nor any of them that have held forth Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in a Popiſh Church; What then?

For you cannot avoide it, this will be the iſſue; either we are counterfeit Profeſſors of Reformation, or that our reformation is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, you ſay you came over for puritie of Ordinances: But in truth, you did but diſſemble, &amp; however you thought, it was not in your hearts, the event proves the contrary; if you be not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, but hollow Members of the Church, and corrupt livers, under the governement and worſhip of God heere eſtabliſhed and ordered, I ſay, you will force all whoſe eyes are on you, throughout the Chriſtian world to thinke, theſe are but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men; there is no truth, no true heartedneſſe in the Religion here eſtabliſhed: and for the Religion eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> what ever you talke of humane inventions, we know there is no ſuch unfaithful dealing, and hollow heartedneſſe, no ſuch bitterneſſe between Chriſtians.

            <p>That Religion, which by the bleſſing of God, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his grace, is diſpenſed heere in ſimplicity, will bee corrupted in the very next generation; you will finde your Children after you (of whoſe ſtate you ought to have as much care, and I thinke, I may ſpeake it without inconveniency) more then of your owne: you may know the worſt of it for your ſelves, being neere the grave many of you: but verely, what will befall your Poſterity?

            </p>
            <p>It was the ſpeech of Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> often in his Sermons, and throughout his Writings (who was one that powred out this Viall) he would ſay to his hearers, Young Schollers: Popiſh Bookes in holding forth the blood of the Covenant, they hold it forth in a morall manner, but without the life and power of his death; hee expounds it thus: They will very evidently ſet forth the cruelty and treachery of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that betrayed him, and the Wordly-mindedneſſe, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and Ambition, of the High Prieſts, that bought and plotted his death; they will (ſaith hee) make bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt the prophaneſſe of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to renounce him, <hi>Away with him, away with him, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him,</hi> and declaime agaiſt the timorouſneſſe of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and baſe-mindedneſſe, that could not deliver an Innocent; and declaime of the cruelty of the Souldiers, and magnifie the Innocencie of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and make the people many times to weepe, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> an Innocent man, had beene thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely ſould and bought, and thus baſely condemned, and cruelly handly: All this might be done, and all but to ſhew forth the blood of an Innocent man. But to ſhew the need of Chriſts blood, and how they ſhould walke worthy of it, and how they ſhould obtaine it, it is the leaſt part of their

               </label> The reaſon is firſt taken,</p>
            <p>From their holding foorth, not indeed the true Chriſt: Whether you ſpeake of their Doctrine, Worſhip, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, they doe not hold forth the true Chriſt. They hold forth Chriſt God and Man, that is true; ſo farre the goe with us, and hold that Chriſt dyed and roſe againe, as we doe, but when they come to ſpeake of the Offices of Chriſt, in which indeede, hee is ſavingly held forth to the people, there they bring in another Chriſt, and renounce him; For either take the true Chriſt, as the true Chriſt, or elſe none, for he will not divide ſtakes. Looke at all his Offices, (And I will give you but a touch of them) Take the Mediatourly Office of Chriſt; they will have other Mediators, of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Interceſſion, beſides the Lord Ieſus.

            <p>Now this is to bring in other Chriſts for Reconciliation, beſides the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Whereas the Apoſtle in the 10 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the 14.

            <p>Now, if they put on Chriſtians the blood of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and give them to riſe by the blood of <hi>Thomas,</hi> there is another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation joyned with the blood of the Lord <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and indeed, all Satisfactory Pennance, and Whippings, and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, what are they all but Copartners with Chriſt, in helping forward his fatisfaction, as if it were not ſufficient; other ſacrificers, and other ſacrifices, every Prieſt is a ſacrificer, and every new ſacrifice is to make attonement.</p>
            <p>And ſo doe I ſay for his mediatourſhip of interceſſion, you know they ioyn ſaints, and angells, eſpecially the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> as the mothers and fathers of grace, and pray the Lord to hear for their merits ſake, ſo that take the whole mediatourly office of Chriſt, for reconciliation, and interceſſion; you muſt have more Chriſts then one, and then he is of none effect, if he may not doe all in point of merit and fatisfaction: even all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that he hath taught us to doe, it is vnprofitable for ſuch ends, we may profit our brethren, and helpe our ſelves by his grace, for many ſpirituall good ends, but for ſatisfaction, for merit and the like it is to ſet up a New Chriſt, beſides the Lord Ieſus, thus is his prieſtly office evacuated.

For the grace of God, <hi>By grace ye are ſaved, not of Workes, Epheſ.</hi> 2.8.9. Now they will not have it of Grace but of Workes, not of living Grace, but of Workes, that is the moſt generall opinion. Nor no redemption of Chriſtians, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all alike, Reprobates and true Chriſtians, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ariſeth in vocation, and that is out of workes, out of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Congruity, and their Iuſtification is out of Merit of Workes, and Perſeverance in Grace, is out of Concurrence of Free will, and Glorification is from Merit of Condignity of Workes, and if all theſe be of workes, here is all the grace of God to ſeek, (what ſaith the Apoſtle?) <hi>If it be of Workes, it is not of Grace, Rom.</hi> 11.6.

They ſee him, whom they have pierced, and mourne for him; they ſee him pierced by them, and for them, and this mourning is Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and ſaving.</p>
            <p>For their obedience, they looke at it, as ſuch as is able to keepe the whole Law of God, and if they can doe that, they ſeeke life, then by Workes, not of Grace: and that Obedience that is able to keepe the whole law of God, is the Obedience of the Scribes and Phariſees, for they ſo taught: and therefore our Saviour tells his diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Except your righteouſneſſe exceedes the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, yee cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> Such obedience, as that a man is able to keepe the whole Law, and by that to merit, and doe no more then the Law requires, it is the obedience of Hereticall preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not of confidence and affiance of Faith: that is, obedience of hereticall preſumption, that is able to keepe the whole law, and make ſatisfaction to the juſtice of Chriſt, and then Chriſt died in vaine, unleſſe hee died to make us Saviours of our ſelves, and that is as notorious as the former.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156636:22"/> vials are poured upon the Antichriſtian world or ſtate. And (as you ſee) they begin with the loweſt elements firſt; The firſt upon the earth, the next upon the ſea, the third upon the rivers and fountaines, the fourth upon the ſun in that world, the fift upon the throne of the Beaſt, the ſixt upon Euphrates, the ſeventh upon the ayre. Now the ſecond Angel (of which you heard the laſt day) having poured out his vial upon the ſea, it became as the bloud of a dead man, and all that lived in that ſea, dyed.</p>
            <p>The ſea (you heard) is the confluence of waters anld rivers, and doth hold forth the confluence or concurrence of all the oracles, and ordinances, and meanes of grace and ſalvation, or thoſe that are pretended ſo to be. The concurrence, or conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them all to one body, which in one word was their Religion in the old Temple, it was reſembled to a brazen ſea, wherein the Prieſts waſhed themſelves; In the Apoſtolique Church of the New Teſtament, it is reſembled unto a ſea of glaſſe, like unto cryſtall, wherein you might ſee the face of Chriſt, as in a mirrour; In Reformed Churches, it is as the of glaſſe, mingled with fire; In Popiſh Churches, it is as the bloud of a dead man; no living bloud is there to be found to waſh the people in, but as the bloud of a dead man, without life, to them that are waſhed in it, and rather fit to choake, and poiſon, and kill, then to give life. Now that being the ſea; Then here the next vial is poured out upon the rivers and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of waters that run into this ſea, and derive this ſea up and downe the earth, <hi>The third Angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters:</hi> And the pouring out of his vial, is deſcribed, Firſt, by the ſubject on which it is poured, <hi>Vpon the rivers and fountains of waters:</hi> Secondly, by the effect, <hi>and they became bloud:</hi> Thirdly, the pouring out of this vial is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by the teſtimony given to it, and the effect of it; What is the teſtimony? It is double, 1. Given by the Angel of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in the 5. <hi>ver.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156636:22"/> by which this powring out of the Viall is amplified, (and the effect of it is juſtified) is by another Angell out of the Altar in the 7. <hi>ver.</hi> who ſaith Amen to this: <hi>Even ſo Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy iudgments.</hi> For the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words.</p>
            <p>The ſea being Religion, the confluence of ordinances, ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as are diſpenſed in any religion: The rivers and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of water that ſpring from the ſea, and returne to the ſea, and derive all their ſprings and waters from thence, they are (and it is generally ſo received, and therefore with more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſpirit a man may declare it) theſe rivers, and fountains of waters are generally conceived to be the Prieſts, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Popiſh Church, who carry Popiſh Religion, as Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rivers do the Sea, up and down the earth; ſo do they Popiſh Religion, up and down the Nations, carry it to and fro, only there is this difference between them, and ordinary rivers and fountains, ordinarily rivers and fountains are freſh, though the ſea be ſalt, but here the fountains &amp; rivers are ſalt and brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh alſo; as thoſe ſalt ſprings be, that run through ſalt mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, which are of like nature with the ſea, and theſe keep their brackiſhneſſe ſtill: And ſo it is with theſe rivers and fountains, they run through the earth, on which the firſt Angel poured out his vial; they run through the curſed earth, as it is plagued of God, and therefore ſtill retaines the like unwholſome ſtreams which are found in the bloody ſea: And therefore it is ſaid, that as the ſea became bloud, ſo theſe rivers alſo became bloud, and carryed but the like kind of water which they received from the ſea, corrupt. As the Religion it ſelfe is corrupt, ſo are theſe fountaines and rivers, the Prieſts and Jeſuites, whether ſecular or regular, that is, the Pariſh Prieſts of their Churches, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Monkes that are in Religious Orders, or who ever are ſent forth by theſe, they are theſe rivers and fountaines of waters that run to and fro to fill all the world with their ſea, with their Religion. It is the ſame word which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath in expreſſing the nature of falſe teachers, though there it is <hi>wells,</hi> yet the words are both one, <hi>They are wells without water,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without water of life, carrying their owne drugs and dregs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. A fit expreſſion (therefore) of ſuch kind of Prieſts or Prophets, as doe convey unwholſome liquor or water up and downe a countrey. Now of theſe it is ſaid, that on the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156636:23"/> out of this vial, they became bloud, not onely in regard that their waters themſelves are bloud, the doctrine and worſhip which they doe hold forth to the people are corrupt, as their ſea is, (like the plague in Egypt, when their waters and rivers were turned to bloud) but that chiefly in regard of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they inflict on them for ſo doing, which is a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy death, as bloud is expounded in the 5. and 6. <hi>verſes,</hi> where the Angel of the waters ſaith, <hi>Thou art righteous, O Lord, &amp;c. becauſe thou haſt iudged thus:</hi> Why? <hi>For they have ſhed the bloud of Saints and Prophets, and thou haſt given them bloud to drinke, for they are worthy:</hi> So this is bloud which God hath given them to drinke. And that is an uſuall phraſe, to give a man bloud to drinke, is to kill him: As <hi>Tomyris</hi> of old ſaid to King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Thou haſt been a bloud-thirſty man, drink thou bloud which thou haſt thirſted. When you give a man bloud to drink, you put him to death. So this Angel, who ever it was, that poured out this vial, he puts theſe Prieſts to death, he gave them bloud to drink, both made themſelves to undergoe a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy death, to drinke bloud, and alſo made all that received and entertained them, to drinke bloud too; and this was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually accompliſhed by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when in the 27. yeare of her raigne, in the yeare 1581. by the conſent of the Parliament, ſhe made it a Law, that if any Prieſt or Jeſuite, that had received Orders from the Sea of Rome, or any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from that Sea, ſhould come into the Realme, and goe about or practice to ſeduce any of the Queenes loyall Subjects from their allegeance, to the obedience of the Sea of Rome, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to draw them to that religion, he ſhould be judged guilty of high treaſon, and ſuffer in the caſe of a Traitor; And this was another branch of that Statute, That if any gave entertainment to ſuch Prieſts and Jeſuites (after cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dayes,) and knew them to be ſuch, ſhould ſuffer as in caſe of Felonie, without the benefit of his Booke; ſo that both of them muſt drinke bloud, both the Jeſuites and Prieſts themſelves, and their abettors and entertainers; and the ground was, becauſe they had bloudy intendments in their comming, intending to kill the Queene, or corrupt the State with unwholſome and pernicious Doctrine, to draw the people from their allegeance, to the obedience of the Sea of Rome, that ſo as it was ſaid, a generation of Catholiques was the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156636:23"/> corruption of her ſubjects: To prevent which miſchiefe, this Law was enacted, and ſo upon this occaſion, many ſuffered that yeare, and others in after yeares, moſt part of her Raigne.</p>
            <p>Now what is then the meaning of the next words, <hi>I heard the Angel of the waters ſay, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and waſt, and ſhalt be, becauſe thou haſt iudged thus:</hi> ſo it was bloud recompenced with bloud. This Angel of the waters, it was he or ſhe that poured out this vial on theſe waters: She with the conſent of her Councel, and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were this Angel of the waters that had this power over theſe rivers and fountaines, and this was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed two or three yeares after, when ſhe ſet Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Cicill</hi> on worke to write a Booke with this Title, JUSTITIA BRITANNIAE, <hi>The Iuſtice of Britaine,</hi> wherein Secretary <hi>Cicill,</hi> by her appointment, doth make it cleare to all neighbour Nations, (and for that end publiſhed his Book in ſundry Languages, French, Dutch, and Spaniſh) that what was decreed in that Parliament was juſt, according to the Law of God, and the true principles of Chriſtian State Policie, that there was no hope of ſafety to the Queenes Perſon, or of peace to the Common wealth, or of liberty to true Reformed Religion, if ſuch perſons were ſuffered to goe up and downe in that peſtilentious manner, to pervert and corrupt the people, and withdraw them from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and ſubject them to the Biſhop of Rome; that they did not ſuffer meerely on point of Religion, though on thoſe points of their Religion which gave them occaſion ſo to work, he doth not deny that neither, but in reſpect that the frame of their Religion was not compatible to any Proteſtant State: And the very Booke it ſelfe holds forth this in effect, that the Lord was juſt herein; and as the Text here tels us, <hi>Thou art righteous, O Lord, becauſe thou haſt iudged thus:</hi> And he attributes not onely righteouſneſſe to God in this, but immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and conſtancie, <hi>which art, and waſt, and ſhalt be alway.</hi> The ſame from the ancient Law of retaliation, in the 24. of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> 19, 20, 21. it is there ordained, that look what a man doth to others, it ſhall be ſo done to him, <hi>Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, &amp;c. They gave thy Prophets
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156636:24"/> and Saints bloud to drinke, and now thou haſt given them bloud to drinke:</hi> This is the reaſon why he acknowledgeth this not onely righteous, but according to his old and ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, his righteouſneſſe ever ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, and ſince the world began: that is Gods manner, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4, 5. <hi>He that ſheds mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed:</hi> God alway hath been of that mind: They that put others to death, that ſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent bloud, <hi>Their bloud ſhall goe for their bloud, Gen.</hi> 9.6. to that purpoſe juſtly ſpeaks that book; it is that which they have found, <hi>for they are worthy.</hi>

            <p>And when he adds further, <hi>I heard another Angel out of the Altar ſay, Even ſo, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy iudgements:</hi> That is another Angel, a Miniſter and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Gods juſtice. This phraſe, <hi>out of the Altar,</hi> in this Book, doth uſually hold forth ſome under-perſecution, either going, or new come out of perſecution: for ſo it is expreſſed in the 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. <hi>I ſaw under the Altar the ſoules of them that were ſlaine for the Word of God, and for the teſtimony which they held.</hi> The Altar is Chriſt, and Chriſt ſuffering; and thoſe under the Altar, are they that ſuffered with Chriſt for the Word of God, ſpeaking of the Primitive Chriſtians in their firſt perſecution: But here he doth not ſay, they were under Martyrdome, but they were come out from under the Altar; And that holds forth thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Low-countreyes, who of a long time had been under perſecution by Duke <hi>Dalva,</hi> and other Spaniſh Princes; Duke <hi>Dalva</hi> boaſts of it, there were 36000. that he had put to death, Hugonites and Proteſtants; Judge you what the reſt might alſo do; and all for the teſtimony of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> for holding forth true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion; but they were all reſcued by the faithfulneſſe of God; giving and bleſſing the courage of Q. <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and now they are got out from under the Altar, and now they are freed from wreſtling with ſuch great difficulties as had been like to ſinke them, if God had not by his ſtretched out arme reſcued them. And looke as in 1584. <hi>Cicill</hi> ſet forth that book, ſo this Angel from under the Altar ſet forth a Law in 1586. wherein by the conſent of all the States generally of the confederate Provinces, they enact and enjoyne, that none of the bloudy ſect of the Jeſuites, nor any of their Scholars, whether he be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or borne in the Land, ſhall have liberty to come into the Countrey, but be put to capitall puniſhment as an enemy to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156636:24"/> the State; and they have been in ſome meaſure carefull of that Law, though more in Grave <hi>Maurice</hi> his time, then ſince; and ſo they juſtly ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the Queens Law, that as ſhe put thoſe Popiſh Emiſſaries to the paine of High Treaſon, hanging, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and quartering, and thus gave them bloud to drink; ſo this Angel from out of the Altar ſaith <hi>Even ſo,</hi> he ſaith <hi>Amen</hi> to it, let it even be ſo with them, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgements; they acknowledge Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, that had given them power to make that Law againſt them, who had ſo lately ſuffered under them; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods righteous judgements; for that State that makes a Law to the ſame purpoſe, which they have found en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in another State, they doe ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to what hath been done, and both the one State and other acknowledge it to be a righteous judgement of God, and the adminiſtration, a juſt law, and a juſt execution. This (as others have done before me) I take to be the naturall and true meaning of this Vial in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall parts thereof, without wreſting of the words, nor neede it be offenſive to any that ſuch particular perſons are named as the accompliſhers of this Vial, conſidering the matters were not of ſmall importance, but of great conſequence and admiration, all ſtates rang of theſe laws, and it raiſed all Chriſtendome in combuſtion, the wars of eighty eight, the Spaniſh invaſion had ſpeciall reſpect to this, and had not the Lord borne witneſſe to his people and their Law, in defeating the intendments of their enemies, againſt both the Nations, it might have been the ruine of them both: So you ſee the meaning of the words of the Text.</p>
            <p>The words are many, and though containing much matter in 4. <hi>verſes,</hi> I ſhall ſhortly contract and recollect the ſubſtance contained in them into one note, and handle that one at this time, as conceiving all the doctrine of theſe words may be graſped together in one Obſervation; For though there be liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of entring into common places of Gods righteouſneſſe and immutability, and of his juſtice in retaliation, and of his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, out of this Text; yet all theſe particulars have been ſpoken to in the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> in the third <hi>verſe,</hi> and in the fourth, <hi>Lord God Almighty, iuſt and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints.</hi> That for God being <hi>ever the ſame, which was and is to come,</hi> we have ſpoken to it divers times before in this book;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156636:25"/> and therefore though they be Catechiſme points, which my place calleth me to attend upon; yet I ſhall not here ſpeak to them, having ſo lately handled the moſt of them, but therefore I will onely ſpeak to this Doctrine, which containes all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

               </label> That upon the diſcovery of the deadly corruption of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Sea of Rome, it was a righteous judgement of God, and ſuch as argued him unchangeable ever, like himſelfe; That the Prieſts and Jeſuites who carryed that Religion up and down the Nations, ſhould be adjudged or condemned to a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy death. This is the ſumme.</p>
            <p>For ſo you ſee it is upon the diſcovery of their ſea of bloud, of the Religion of the Sea of Rome, to be a Sea of bloud. We ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſhewed before, that <hi>The ſecond Angel poured out his vial on the ſea,</hi> that is, on the Religion of the Sea of Rome, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it to be as the bloud of a dead man, made it manifeſtly appeare, that both their doctrine, and worſhip, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was deadly, and ſuch as was utterly unwholſome, both for private families and States, Church and Common-wealth; and ſo corrupt, as was deadly; who ever lived and dyed in that Religion, lived an hypocrite, and dyed a reprobate. Now the next Angel that comes, upon this diſcovery, he <hi>poures his vial on the rivers and fountaines of waters, and they became bloud:</hi> That is, they make Lawes to adjudge all that carry that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on up and downe the Nation, to be guilty of bloud, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be put to death, as Traitors and Rebels againſt the State. And this is acknowledged by the Angels of God, I meane thoſe that are Miniſters of Gods Juſtice, and approve this teſtimony as authenticall; they acknowledge this a righteous judgement of God, as he that is, was, and ſhall be alway one and the ſame. Thus he was wont to carry it, and thus he doth ſtill. In old time, if a man played the falſe Prophet, and ſuggeſted ſuch devices as theſe, the Lord judged him to death, this was his manner: And ſo in the New Teſtament, as in the Old, he condemnes all ſuch to death, (and he is moſt righteous in ſo doing.) This is the ſumme.</p>
            <p>It was a great while before this, though not full two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, when <hi>Zachary</hi> propheſyed, that <hi>God would cut off the falſe Prophet,</hi> in the 13. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>and if there were any falſe Prophet ſhould ariſe, his father and mother ſhould thruſt him
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156636:25"/> through, becauſe he ſpake lyes in the name of the God of truth, he ſhould not live.</hi> And they ſpeak not of his Typicall death, that is, of his death by Church cenſure, or baniſhment, which have a kind of death in them; but they ſpeak of ſuch a death, as that he was not worthy to live; To caſt a lye upon the God of Truth, the Oracle of Truth. But long before <hi>Zachary,</hi> this was an ancient law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> this was a law, that falſe Prophets, they that turned Religion to the blood of a dead man, that did fundamentally pervert Religion, they ſhould not live. And minde the reaſon that God gives here, partly in this text, and partly in other Scriptures.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> A ſecond reaſon is taken from the point of ſeducement: As all blaſphemous heretiques, ſo ſeducing heretiques are to be put to death. In that reſpect that whole 13. of <hi>Deut.</hi> is ſpent about the ſeducing of falſe prophets: and he puts a threefold gradation, <hi>If he be a Prophet,</hi> (therefore though never ſo ſeemingly holy by his place and gifts,) yet <hi>if he turn you away from the Lord your God, and draw you from the wayes of God,</hi> what then? <hi>thine eye ſhall not ſpare him, he ſhall ſurely be put to death,</hi> from the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> to 5. from the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> to 11. <hi>he will have no neereneſſe of blood to hinder from due execution of Iuſtice: but if it be thy brother, the ſonne of thy mother, or thy daughter, or the wife of th boſome, or thy friend, which is as thy own ſoule that ſhall goe about to ſeduce thee ſecretly, ſaying, let us goe and ſerve other Gods which thou haſt not known, thou ſhalt not conſent unto him, nor hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, thine eye ſhall not ſpare him, neither ſhalt thou conceale him, but thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, thine hand ſhall be firſt upon him to put him to death, &amp;c.</hi> from the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> to the end. If there be never ſo many that ſhall joyn, if a whole City ſhall joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch a courſe, thou ſhalt riſe againſt, and deſtroy the City, and burne it with fire, and leave not a ſtone upon a ſtone which ſhall not be thrown down, in utter deteſtation of that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And he gives a notable reaſon for it, why a ſeducer ſhould be thus dealt withall, becauſe, ſaith he, he ſeekes to turne thee away from thy way, and to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God, to turne thee off either by deceit, or to thruſt thee off by eaneſt perſwaſions; and therefore leſt you ſhould think theſe falſe prophets faile onely in the object of worſhip, and not in manner of worſhipping, therefore conſider in the 22. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> when the two tribes and a halfe ſet up an Altar by <hi>Iordan,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they thought not they would bring in another object of worſhip, but another manner of worſhip, (here is but another way of worſhip, whether mediation or ſatisfaction of Gods wrath deviſed) the whole ten Tribes riſe up, and ſend a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Company or Troop of Militarie men to goe and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with them, and know whether it were true; and either they would reclaime them from it by argument, or make warre againſt them; and they had cut off two Tribes and an halfe, if they had found another Altar for worſhip: Now he that ſets up another Mediator or Mediation, Saint or Angel, he ſets up as great a matter as another Altar; or he that brings in other mens
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:156636:26"/> merits, he brings in another Altar: Therefore by the ancient Lawes of that unchangeable God that thought it unſufferable in thoſe dayes, he thinks it unſufferable now that Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites ſhould bring in other Altars, other Mediations and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, as Prayers of Saints and Angels; the Lord looks at it as deeply meritorious of a bloudy death, as in former times. He is the ſame God, and his zeale and jealouſie is deeply provoked againſt the like kind of viciouſneſſe now as ever it was then. That is a ſecond Argument.</p>
            <p>And yet in point of ſeducement, this I will ſay, that if a man upon conviction ſhall ſee the wickedneſſe of his way, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his ſoule before God, and give ſatisfaction to the Church and State where he ſhall be convinced, on ſuch conviction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, we find liberty to pardon; but yet ſtigmatize him, as in the 13. of <hi>Zach. If the Prophet, ſhall repent, and ſay, I am no Prophet, nor the ſonne of a Prophet, but an Husbandman, and my father taught me to keep beaſts or ſheep, and therefore he will not weare a rough garment to deceive; And if any man aske him, What are thoſe wounds in thine hands? he ſhall anſwer, Thoſe with which I was wounded in the houſe of my friends, Zach.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6. That ſhews in ſuch a caſe they ſaved his life, but they inflict ſome pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on him, to carry away with him. And this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not of the dayes of the Old Teſtament, but it is written to be done when there is a fountain opened to the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and to the Inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for ſinne and for uncleanneſſe, in the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> And in the 7. <hi>ver.</hi> when the Lord calls for a ſword againſt his Shepheard, and againſt the man that is his fellow, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his companions his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>He will ſmite the ſhepheard, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered,</hi> (and thoſe are the dayes of the New Teſtament) in thoſe times it is, when the Prophets ſhall be thus cut off that riſe up to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the people of God.</p>

            <p>And they doe notably abuſe the old type of Leproſie for this: <hi>Vzziah</hi> being once ſmitten with leproſie, then the High Prieſt removes him from the Temple of the Lord, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:156636:27"/> he may not be ſuffered any more to governe; for if once the Lord finite a man with leproſie in his judgement, (and indeed, let hereſie be one kinde of leproſie) if the Prieſt pronounce him ſo, then he is cut off from the government of the Countrey, then his people are not ſubject to him, and ſo ſubjects are freed from their fidelity to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Prince, which is a notable abuſe of that place: For God doth not intend that the authority of any Miniſter or Prieſt in the Old or New Teſtament ſhould ſo farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, that what they did in the Old Teſtament to <hi>Vzziah,</hi> ſhould take off Princes from their Goverment in the New: For even in the old Teſtament they ſtill retained the Crown, though their power of execution was delegated to another; and that not by the High-Prieſts appointment, but by himſelfe.</p>
            <p>But as things were with them, ſo though not in the ſame kinde, but in a typicall way, it befalls Princes in the New Teſtament. If a man were found a Leper in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee was ſequeſtred from the adminiſtration of his Kingdome, and from his owne houſe, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 13.46. he muſt not live in the Campe, or in the Towne or Village, but alone, and in a ſeparate place by himſelfe, (as thoſe that are ſick of the Peſtilence in our Native Countrey) they are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to live in the towne, but in Peſt-houſes, unleſſe there be a generall infection.</p>
            <p>But this thing muſt not be applyed in the letter to the ſtate of the Church, in the New Teſtament; for Leproſie was not onely a type of ſcandalous, infectious ſins, but it was alſo a bodily, noyſome, infectious diſeaſe, and made a man unfit for civill commerce.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as Leproſie was alſo a type of ſcandalous and infectious ſinnes, ſo the ſequeſtring of <hi>Vzziah</hi> from the Temple, doth type forth, not that Chriſtian Kings ſhould be ſeparate from their thrones; For he that gives to a man a Kingdome, or any earthly eſtate, doth not debarre that man from his houſe, if he be a private man, nor from his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if he be a publique perſon.</p>
            <p>But what is the Kingdome that is typed out?</p>
            <p>It is the Kingdome of the glory of CHRIST JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS: If therefore hee be ſhut out from the holy Temple

               </label> The Papiſts are not of that mind, but they execute it in the letter; they have put to death the Prophets and ſervants of God in the letter; hunted them up and downe; the Inquiſition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more bloudy then any other other Butchery. They doe not, nor may not plead any ſuch thing; they beleeve it is true in the letter. And let me ſay further, the holy Ghoſt makes it as true in the letter; this Text is in the New Teſtament, not in the Old, <hi>Thou haſt given them bloud to drinke, for they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:</hi> and he ſpeaks of the very bloud of the hearts of men: And it is parallel with Gods juſtice of old; it was juſt then, and it is juſt now. <hi>Zachary</hi> intends the dayes of the New Teſtament, though written in the Old, that when a <hi>fountaine is opened to the houſe of David, and inhabitants of Ieruſalem, for ſinne and for uncleanneſſe,</hi> then the father and mother of a falſe Prophet ſhall accuſe him to the Magiſtrate, and ſhall ſay unto him, <hi>He ſhall not live.</hi> Was it an abomination then to ſpeak lyes in the Name of the Lord, and no leſſe then blaſphemie, and ſhall it be more favourably interpreted now? A man may now ſpeak a lye, and bring in a falſe Chriſt, a falſe Mediator, and falſe meanes of ſatisfaction, and falſe merits, now he may without perill of his life, in the Old Teſtament he might not. Why but was it not ſufficient to have a ſpirituall judgement? Even they had ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall judgements then; but God ſaw it meet to inflict ſome temporall judgement as well as ſpirituall, and is now his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment changed?</p>
            <p>Beſides, are not <hi>Moſes</hi> Morall Lawes of perpetuall equity, and therefore to be obſerved in all Ages? Is blaſphemy more tolerable in the New Teſtament, or thruſting men away from God? is it not as odious now as then? Is not murther of ſoules as damnable now as then? Is not conſpiracie and ſedition as damnable and capital now as then? Is not the law of retaliation as juſt in the New Teſtament as in the old? and therefore a man would wonder that ſuch frivolous interpretations ſhould come into the hearts of men, to hinder the free paſſage of the juſtice of God, on ſuch notorious offenders.</p>

               </label> Why doe you thinke Heretiques were not as conſcionable in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:156636:30"/> the Old Teſtament as now? If any man had a conſcience to turn men from God, he would have men of as much conſcience to cut them off; if they make no conſcience of the blaſpheming the name of God, the Lord would have, men make no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of cutting them off from breathing in the aire of God; If men make no conſcience of murthering ſoules, or raiſing ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tumult, and murthering men better then themſelves, the Lord would have men make no conſcience of paying every man in his owne kind.</p>
            <p>But let me anſwer again, But mark what I ſay, the Lord will eaſily provide for this, and ſo he doth: and in England I am ſure he hath, (what in Holland I know not, but) he hath provided there, That if a Jeſuite or Prieſt, or their abettors, ſhall come in, and take the oath of fidelity to the State, and ſo carry matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Juſtice of Peace, the Law diſchargeth them from capitall puniſhment: And the Law of God in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that ſuch ſhould be once or twice admoniſhed, but if he ſtill continue, the Apoſtle would have him caſt out of the Church; the Church hath no farther power; if they be procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with farther, it muſt be by the Magiſtrate: Him that is an heretique, ofter once or twice admonition, reject, knowing that he that is ſuch, is ſubverted, &amp;c. So that it muſt be for Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Articles of Religion in doctrine or worſhip, which are ſo clearly delivered in the Word, that no man that underſtands Scripture, and the wayes of ſalvation, but may be ſatisfied in conſcience what is the holy and acceptable will of God in ſuch points; and therefore he takes it for granted, if a man be once or twice admoniſhed, he is convinced of himſelfe, he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, he is turned off from the foundation, that now no man is put to death for his conſcience, but for ſinning againſt the light of his conſcience; his owne conſcience hath convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, and the light of the Word is ſo cleare, as cannot but convince him, that the way of God runnes juſt quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his interpretation and ſeducement: And therefore now if you ſinne, you ſinne againſt conſcience, and therefore you juſtly ſuffer for being ſubverted, and turned off from the foundation, from Chrift Jeſus, and holding another founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perſiſting therein obſtinately. So there are two things in an heretique, he is both ſubverted himſelfe, as an houſe from the foundation, it is againſt the foundation of Religion;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:156636:31"/> and he holdeth out obſtinately againſt light of conſcience, with ſtubbornneſſe; and now in ſuch a caſe thine eye ſhall not ſpare him. A ſoule that ſins of ignorance, may be pardoned, but if he ſtill continue obſtinate, thine eye ſhall not ſpare him; the wrath of God now goes out againſt a perſon, againſt a City; if it were againſt a Tribe, they goe about by force of Armes to redreſſe it; they ſhall not ſuffer ſuch in a Country. This is then the Anſwer to the ſecond Objection, and ſtill juſtifies the equity of that Law.</p>

            <p>What is then meant by <hi>Tares?</hi> Not ſuch as ſinne through obſtinacie, but hyhocrites that are like the ſervants of God, that you would think they are ſuch; after you diſcover them, they are empty eares; and hollow, have no fatneſſe of graine, and that is indeed none of the wheat.

So you ſee the firſt Uſe, to juſtifie the equity and ſoveraignty of ſuch capitall puniſhments on Prieſts and Jeſuites, and conſequently on ſuch as bring in other Gods, or another way of worſhipping the true God, then that wherein we may enjoy fellowſhip with the true God, the juſtice and ſuitableneſſe of it to the holy will of God, ſince there were any Lawes made amongſt Gods people.</p>

There are ſundry Laws particular to that Polity, which had peculiar reaſons for them, as to marry in their kindred, to keep their inheritance to their Tribe, we have not that reaſon: But where the Laws are of like morall reaſon, as will hold in all Ages, and in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, as it is in all the capitall Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there is no reaſon why a Jew ſhould be put to death for point of Adultery, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, or for ſtealling a man, and ſelling him to a Pagan, more then a Chriſtian. I ſay therefore look what was the Law of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> if it were of perpetuall reaſon and equity, it lyes on every Common-wealth to eſtabliſh the ſame, and to take your ſelves as much bound to it as the Jews, why? for the Text tels us, the very righteouſneſſe of God is in it: And looke as he was then a hater ofall wickednes with a perfect hatred, and as he was juſt, ſo he is ſtill, hereſie is no more pleaſing to him, nor blaſphemy, nor ſeducing, nor to change the way of his worſhip, and to draw men to wayes wherein they cannot enjoy the Lord in peace; murder of ſoules is no more welcome to him now, then of old. And therefore if there were a Law to puniſh ſuch with capitall puniſhment, it is a like juſtice of God to enjoyne ſuch Laws in every Chriſtian Common-wealth. And therefore if we look at Gods juſtice as unchangeable, we may not prevaricate judiciall laws, ſetting aſide ſome typicall conſiderations, or ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conſideration, in regard of their Polity: But ſuch as were to puniſh men by death, or were received on morall equity and ground, looke what was for them to doe there, is the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for us; put the ſame caſe, and you will finde the like reaſon for the ſame puniſhment. It is true, ſome ceremonies were there puniſhed with death, and ſo the like kind of profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sabbath, is as juſtly puniſhable with us, if profaned with an high hand; to gather ſticks with an high hand, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Sabbath of the Lord, is as juſtly puniſhable with death now as then. And ſo you may ſay of any other law juſtly puniſhable by death, and that are built on perpetuall moral equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Our God is the ſame God that he was; and ſo you ſhall have him count that righteous whiles the world ſtands.</p>
            <p>For a ſixt. This may ſerve to take off a corrupt interpretation <label type="milestone">

It is true, thoſe here were Governours of the narrow ſeas, and the that gave commiſſion to execute the righteous judgement of God upon thoſe rivers, ſhe was Admirall of the narrow ſeas, but that is not the meaning. But the Angel that poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters, it is he or ſhe that did execute the righteous judgment of God upon the Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuites; and that did both Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and he that had a great hand in executing that judgement, and the Angel from under the Altar, they ratified that Law, and juſtified it when they had done. Now it is true, the Angels of God aſſiſt the ſervants of God in this glorious work, but they are ſent forth, indifferently, to protect Gods ſervants by ſea or by land: And I finde no Scripture to ſhew that they are more particularly ſent to the ſea, or to the earth, but indifferently to protect Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in their out-goings and in-commings.</p>

If Popiſh Prieſts be rivers and fountaines of waters, drinking bloud, becauſe they have made Gods ſervants and Prophets drink bloud, then it ſhews what place other Miniſters be in, where the ſea is cleare as glaſſe, like chryſtall, where you may ſee the face of Chriſt as in a glaſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. what then? where the ſea is pure, all Miniſters of the Countrey, and Elders of Churches, carry forth the doctrine and worſhip of Chriſt, they are as rivers and fountaines, and being living water, rivers of freſh water, and water all the Countrey. This is the office of of them, in oppoſition to thoſe in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. that are <hi>wells with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water,</hi> without ſweet water. Godly Miniſters therefore are fountaines of ſweet water, and from them iſſue forth ſtreames of living water. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. <hi>ult. All my freſh ſprings are in thee.</hi> I would onely apply it thus, and leave it and the Text with the time: That therefore looke as a man when he would goe forth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:156636:52"/> to a new Plantation, or ſit downe in any place, or if he would ſet his dwelling houſe in a place, he would wiſely fore-caſt to have a fountaine of living water, a living ſpring neere to his houſe, or ſome ſweet ſpring run neere him. Why? If he be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out freſh water, it is a great want for the proviſion of his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold: Water they muſt have, either a freſh tiver, or a freſh ſpring, the one of the two; if they can have both, they covet both: and there is great need of both, not onely to quench fire, and water gardens, &amp;c. but for boiling of meat and drink, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of cloathes, and ſundry victuals. Water is ever neceſſary, as any thing; nothing more. This is mens care, when they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Plantations, or whether they plant townes or villages, or their owne dwelling houſes, they have a care to provide for freſh water. All I would ſay is this, Take heed you doe not provide for fountaines of ordinary water, and neglect rivers of ſweet water: That is, beware of going about ſuch work, without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſuch fountaines with you, as may from the ſea of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, pure doctrine, and pure worſhip, carry forth ſome ſuch ſweet ſtreams as may make glad the hearts of your families, and Church of God where you goe.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Have not Chriſtians ſo much liberty, a <label type="milestone">

               </label> this let me ſay, you would be loth to provide no better for temporals, you would be loth to ſet a towne where there are no rivers nor fountaines; and if you doe ſit downe where there are no fountaines, yet you have liberty to fetch water from other places, Chriſt hath purchaſed it: True, he hath purchaſed all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties for his Church, but you will not think it wiſdome to ſit downe where there are no rivers, becauſe you have no right to them by the bloud of Jeſus; that would not be a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in things concerning this naturall life: why then doe not build further on the bloud of Chriſt for ſpirituall rivers, then you will doe for naturall; but rather prize ſpirituall rivers above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, as more worthy then all naturall comforts to be looked after. Therefore when ever you are about ſuch a work as this,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:156636:53"/> take the Lord Jeſus Chriſt along with you, and take rivers and fountaines of waters; that as you look for rivers and fountains for the refreſhment of your cattle, and ſervants, and children, you may finde a living fountaine of the bloud of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed and running in the plantation where you intend to ſit downe; otherwiſe you will finde the ſprings there, and the fountains and rivers you ſit downe by, riſe up in judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, that theſe are the things you ſought for, and out of regard to theſe, you left the fountains and rivers of Gods houſe, the ordinances of God behind you, and goe and live in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt corners of a countrey, or in ſome other countrey, all is one; Therefore ſit downe no where without good Miniſters, if it be poſſible, and ſure poſſible it is, elſe Chriſtians may reſolve to tarry where they are, as <hi>Ezra</hi> tarried by the river <hi>Ahava,</hi> in the 8. of <hi>Ezra</hi> 15. till he had got ſome Levites to goe with them, that they might goe and make a comfortable worke of it, that they might not leave the Ordinances behind them; and yet there were ſome there before, whither they went. It is true, ſome may goe and make a beginning, but yet never make a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but where you may come and partake of the waters of Gods houſe every Lords day, and let them that cannot ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, let them continue where they are, and drink of the waters of eternall life, rather then run ſuch hazards. You have ſeene when ſome have made a beginning without Miniſters, they have ſtaid three or foure yeeres before they have got any help, and when they have got them, they have had much adoe to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: they have been ſuddenly unſettled, though they have not gone raſhly about it, but with good advice: but for want of this there, not taking theſe rivers and fountaines with them, they have been at a loſſe, and therefore in ſuch a caſe let it be the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſincere hearted Chriſtians, that come from old England for liberty and purity of Ordinances, not to leave them now for freſh medows and fountaines: and for want of planting ground, and the like, it will not be ſuitable to theſe ends for which you left your native Countrey.</p>

               </gap>ſſors of the truth of Chriſt, their breaſts girded with the golden girdles of truth. Further, they are all of them ſaid to receive a command
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156636:54"/> from God to pour out the Vials of his wrath, and all of them to pour out the Vials of his wrath upon the earth; in the firſt Verſe of this Chapter: and yet it was but the firſt that poured out his Vial upon the earth; for the ſecond is ſaid to pour it out upon the Sea; and the third upon the rivers and fountains; and the fourth (you read in my Text) <hi>upon the Sun;</hi> and the fifth upon the Throne of the Beaſt; and the ſixth upon the great river <hi>Euphrates;</hi> and the laſt upon the air: yet all are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (the whole ſeven) <hi>to pour out the wrath of God upon the earth,</hi> in the firſt verſe. The earth being oppoſed to the Church in heaven, the viſible Church open in heavenly purity; it is ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſome earthly, carnall, Antichriſtian ſtate, or Church: but when it is not oppoſed to heaven, but other elements, then it is the loweſt of all the reſt; and ſo it is according to this double oppoſition interpreted in this Chapter. If you look at the earth, as oppoſite to heaven, the heavenly pure Churches, ſo he means the earthly and Antichriſtian Church, the Romiſh Popiſh Church that then was. Now if you ſay, as in the firſt verſe it is ſaid, <hi>The firſt onely poured out his vial upon the earth;</hi> now you mean the loweſt element of the Antichriſtian ſtate, the common Catholicks, whereupon there fell a grievous ſore upon all that received the mark of the Beaſt, and worſhipped his Image. When thoſe holy ſervants, and faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt did diſcover the corruption of Religion in common Catholicks, the Catholicks were afflicted with much confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and indignation; as being convinced, they were bedabled with groſſe ſuperſtition, ignorance, and idolatry, and many other evils which you have formerly heard: So that you ſee, the firſt of them fell upon the Beaſt; and ſo from the firſt to the laſt, the firſt began with the Beaſt; and in the laſt, <hi>Babylon is fallen,</hi> in the 19 Verſe of this Chapter. So that all theſe Vials poured out the wrath of God upon ſomething or other of the Beaſt; the firſt upon the common worſhippers of the Beaſt; the ſecond upon the Sea; that is, the confluence of all the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that is, ſuch Ordinances as the worſhippers of the Beaſt have in their Religion; and they diſcovered that Sea to be but the bloud of a dead man, not to have the life of Chriſt in it: And the third poured out his Vial upon the Fountains and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of water, which are the Prieſts and Jeſuits of that Church,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156636:54"/> which carry that Religion up and down the earth, as the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Fountains do the water of the Sea (and of theſe you heard at large the laſt day:) And look as the opening of the Seals (mentioned before in this Book) did open the wrath of God, and his judgements aginſt the Roman-Pagan Empire, and the ſeven Trumpets did ſound out the wrath of God againſt the Roman-Chriſtian Empire and Church; ſo theſe laſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, with the laſt wrath in the ſeven Vials, they pour it all out upon the Antichriſtian Roman ſtate: So that all the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this Book are ſtill upon <hi>Rome;</hi> either <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, or <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian, or <hi>Rome</hi> Antichriſtian; the one falls under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Seals, the other under ſeven Trumpets, and this laſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeven Vials: So that if the earth, upon which the firſt Angel poured out his Vial, be the common ſort of Catholicks; and the Sea, upon which the ſecond Angel poured out his Vial, be their Religion, and convinced it to be the bloud of a dead man, and no life of the bloud of Chriſt in it, to waſh ſin from the ſouls and conſciences of men, nothing elſe but unwholſome and unſavoury choking corruptions, ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all that were waſhed in it, or drank of it. And the third Vial being poured out upon the Jeſuits and Prieſts, they were thereby adjudged to capitall puniſhment (as you have heard) for they were forced to drink bloud, as they were worthy, having cauſed the Martyrs of CHRIST JESUS to drink bloud.</p>
            <p>This fourth Vial therefore comes to be poured out upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Beaſt, as all the reſt of the Vials were: The fourth Angel poured out his Vial upon the Sun, to wit, ſomething of the Beaſt, which reſembles the Sun in his world, even as the Sun is the greateſt light in this materiall world, which GOD created in the beginning. In theſe words then you may ſee deſcribed, the pouring out of the Vial of the fourth Angel, which is ſet forth by the ſubject upon which it is poured, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the ſun:</hi> Secondly, by the effect which followed upon that, <hi>He had power given him to ſcorch men with fire;</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Men were tormented with great heat upon it.</hi> And a third Argument, by which this Vial poured out, is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, is the event which followed, and that is double, <hi>Men blaſphemed the name of God;</hi> and God here deſcribed to have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156636:55"/> power over theſe plagues, as an aggravation of that blaſphemy, to blaſpheme the name of God, that had power over theſe plagues. And ſecondly, they are deſcribed by another event, their Impenitencie, their not repenting, <hi>they repented not to give him glory:</hi> So that here the fourth Vial is poured out, Upon what? Upon the Sun. What is the effect of that? Power is is given to that Angel, <hi>to ſcorch men with fire; and men were ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with heat:</hi> and the event of it was, they that were ſo ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, continued ſtill impenitent, <hi>they repented not to give God glory;</hi> but on the contrary, blaſphemed the name of the great God, that had power over theſe plagues.</p>
            <p>For opening the meaning of the words briefly; By the Sun cannot here be meant, that body of the Sun that gives light to us in theſe viſible heavens: For how ſhall an Angel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the Temple, out of a reformed Church, pour out his Vial upon that Sun? Or if he ſhould be able ſo to do, how ſhould he work any diſtempered heat in it, but it would annoy reformed Churches as well as Antichriſtian? How will it reflect a peculiar plague upon Antichriſt? It muſt therefore be ſome other Sun, and indeed ſuch a Sun as is wrapped up under the generall Notion of Earth; for all the Angels poured out their Vials upon the earth; they had no other Commiſſion given them to pour out their Vials, but upon the earth, in the firſt Verſe. And therefore he that poured out his Vial upon the Sea, it was but an earthly ſea, a worldly ſea; and hee that poured his Vial upon the rivers and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, did but pour it out upon earthly rivers and fountains: and therefore he that pours his out upon the Sun, doth but pour it out upon an earthly Sun, not an heavenly Sun; I mean not any ſpirituall Sun of heavenly brightneſſe or glory: Minde therefore, that it cannot be allowed to interpret this Sun to be the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as ſome good Interpreters have expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, (he is indeed the Sun of true viſible reformed Churches, but not of Antichriſtian:) Now will it be in like ſort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to interpret it of the Scriptures, (as ſome of our beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters have expounded it) for theſe are but one; for the Scriptures reveal Chriſt, and the woman cloathed with the Sun, that is Chriſt, ſhe is cloathed with him as he is revealed in the Scripture, 12 <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. But I do not ſee how it ſhould well be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156636:55"/> allowed, that that ſhould be the Sun here meant: For firſt, the Angels that pour out theſe Vials, are all godly men, at leaſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo reputed, and accounted, and acknowledged by the Churches; they are cloathed with pure white linnen, which is the righteouſneſſe of the Saints, inherent and imputed: They are alſo girded with gelden girdles, ſincere prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſors of the truth; and how theſe can be imagined to pour out wrath upon the Lord Ieſus, or the Scriptures, it is not to be beleeved or conceived.</p>
            <p>And beſides, all theſe had command to pour out the wrath of God on thoſe ſubjects, upon which they poured out their Vials, as in the firſt Verſe. Now God forbid we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that any wrath of God ſhould be poured out upon Chriſt ever ſince his Reſurrection, or that any wrath of God ſhould be poured out upon the Scriptures: For although they that thus expound this Vial to be poured out upon the Sun, do not ſay that the wrath of God was poured upon the Sun, but upon the Antichriſtian ſtate; yet the Text tels us, <hi>they poured out the Vials of the wrath of God upon that ſubject;</hi> that they poured them on, they poured them all upon the earth: So that all theſe things are but earthly matters, and ſuch earthly matters as have been open juſtly to the wrath of God. It is therefore but an earthly ſea, and they are but earthly rivers and fountains, and it is but an earthly Sun, and an earthly air, corrupt air, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome Antichriſtian air, upon which the Vials are poured. So that I cannot go ſo freely along with that Expoſition, that the Sun here, is Chriſt revealed in the Scriptures, or the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures revealing Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall ſay, but the Sun ſpoken of in the Trumpets, was Chriſt in the Scriptures, or the Scriptures revealing Chriſt, &amp; thoſe Trumpets hold forth a like degree of judgement upon the Roman-Chriſtian Empire, as here upon Antichriſtian <hi>Rome:</hi> For upon the ſounding of the firſt Trumpet, judgement fals upon the earth, common Chriſtians: The ſecond Trumpet ſounding, judgement fals upon the Sea, (as in the 8 <hi>Revel.</hi> 7, to 12.) And the third upon rivers and fountains: And the fourth Trumpet ſounding, did bring an hand of God upon the Sun, a third part of the Sun was ſmitten; that is, the Son Chriſt Ieſus was much darkned in that degenerated Chriſtian-ſtate,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156636:56"/> and ſo it was with the Scriptures, with the Church ſtate, and with humane Learning, they were all darkened, as it is there deſcribed: But (minde you) the Sun is one thing to a Church that hath truth in it, though degenerated; CHRIST was their light, though they were darkened, in a third part: But now when Religion is wholly corrupt, that all the whole Sea is the bloud of a dead man; now the world is altered, and if you have a new world, you muſt have a new Sun: That was a Chriſtian world, and CHRIST might ſtill be the Sun, and light of that, though in many degrees corrupted; and the Scriptures might be ſtill the light of the world. But now when you come to an Antichriſtian world, ſo wholly degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that there is no power of CHRIST to be ſeen, as they adminiſter any Ordinance; now the caſe is ſo far chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that you muſt look for another Sun in another world: Here is another earth, and another Sea, that Sea was not like the bloud of a dead man (though corrupt) but this is; and thoſe waters, though their Teachers were corrupt, yet it was but a third part; but here all is become bloud, and they drink of bloud, <hi>for they are worthy.</hi> And here is another Sun in this new world, and what muſt that be? In a word, there be others that interpret it of the greateſt and moſt illuſtrious light, moſt eminent and glorious light in the Antichriſtian world: And what may that be? If you look through all the Antichriſtian world, what ſhould be the moſt eminent, and moſt glorious, and moſt illuſtrious light that ſhines in the greateſt glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all? What doth more readily offer it ſelf then the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the chief governour in the Antichriſtian ſtate, of eminent luſtre, and hath been ſo for 200 yeers, as they call it, the Lumen, and Columen of that ſtate, the light and pillar of that ſtate? And they that ſo expound it, they wrote juſt in this time when the king of <hi>Sweden</hi> came forth to repreſent the Angel, he with his followers, to pour out a Vial of GODS wrath upon the Imperiall ſtate of <hi>Germany,</hi> and conſequently upon the reſt of that houſe that were allyed to them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spaniards or others; and that to the provoking of ſo much indignation, you know what ſcornfull deriſions they put upon him, as if he came in like a Tinker with his Copper money, rather then a worthy Generall; and you know what indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156636:56"/> and wrath hath been kindled by that means againſt all <hi>Germany;</hi> what a world of bloud hath been ſpilt; how fire and ſword hath purſued thoſe attempts to this very day? What might be ſaid againſt this Interpretation, is not much, but yet ſo much, as to make ſome addition to this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts will by no means bear and acknowledge it, that any Civil ſtate ſhould be the moſt Illuſtrious light of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; they will tell you that the Emperour is but a borrowed light from the Sun, and doth owe homage to the Pope for his Imperiall Crown, that have tranſlated the Empire from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Germany;</hi> They will tell you, the Pope is as much above the Emperour, as the Sun is above the Moon. And they are not aſhamed to ſpeak to the Pope, in the amplification of his glory, Thou art the light of the world, the flower of Paradiſe, the gate of Heaven: And if they make the Pope their greateſt light, their moſt tranſcendent and Illuſtrious light, the Sun in the primeſt and chiefeſt glory, then you muſt look and ſearch ſomewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſome further Interpretation then meerly the Imperiall ſtate, or the ſtate of that ſame Family combined and united unto it.</p>
            <p>And yet neither would I wholly wave that Interpretation of the Imperiall ſtate, becauſe the matter is not what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts will acknowledge, or what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will own, Whether they will own the Emperour to bee the primeſt and chiefeſf light, or others; for the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of things as they be, as well as how they are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be.</p>
            <p>Now in Scripture Interpretation, the greateſt lights are Magiſtrates, that hold forth the greateſt luſtre and ſplendor, but yet in the Churches; and when you ſpeak of ſpirituall Adminiſtrations, they that are to derive light from CHRIST to the Church, they are the greateſt lights for ſpirituall things: But wee come to ſpeak therefore of the great light they ſet up, they ſet up him as the chiefeſt and greateſt light, which derives light to the very Scriptures; for they conceive that they ſhould not bee Authenticall,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156636:57"/> unleſſe the B: of <hi>Rome</hi> count them ſo; and if he do count them authenticall, then they ſhall be ſo, though they be <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> and no ſence of Scripture allowed for the light of truth, unleſſe it be acknowledged by him; nor no Decrees go for currant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ratifie them: So that that which they take for the light of their world, is chiefly the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> If then he be their greateſt light, then this Angel pours his Vial of Gods wrath upon the Pope his tranſcendent light, whereby he gives authority to the Scriptures, to Doctrine, to Worſhip, to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to Councels, and whereby he gives power to all his Officers, to adminiſter Diſcipline and Church-power in all Chriſtendom, (as they call it) all Chriſtian Churches over. Then they are the Angels that pour out the Vial upon that Sun, that take from him that tranſcendent Prerogative of the Sun, which is to rule by day, 136 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. Take then from him his rule by day; for you muſt ſpeak of things metaphorically in this place, though in the Pſalm is meant another Sun; but in this Sun, take from the Pope, from this Sun Popiſh rule of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the rule of all Churches, the Soveraign power in all Eccleſiaſticall affairs; and what then? Then you will pour out a Vial of wrath upon him: And ſo did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in her time; and the Parliament then by making the Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and the defence of it, high Treaſon againſt her perſon, and the State of the Kingdom, and againſt the Lord Ieſus: It poured forth ſuch a Vial of Gods wrath upon this great Light, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian State; that it rules no more by day, neither in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> nor <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor divers other neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who by her precedent example did abandon the like uſurpation, the ſupreme rule of the Pope in Eccleſiaſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which is the very Rule of the Churches of Chriſt. Thus you ſee, take the one, or the other, both will ſtand together: Let the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> be the Sun, as it is in his kinde and Sphaere, the greateſt light of all their created Civil power, and hath been a great light indeed, and both an ornament and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> Or take the Pope himſelf, who will be the greateſt Church-light, and claims to himſelf Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power, not onely in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, but Civil too. It is no unuſuall thing in Scripture, to make a graduall Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of dark Scriptures; as in the 17 Chapter, <hi>The ſeven
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156636:57"/> beads</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>are ſeven mountains, upon which the woman ſitteth;</hi> and (in the 10 verſe) they are alſo ſeven Kings; the ſame that repreſent ſeven mountains, doth repreſent ſeven Kings. And ſo both theſe are great lights of that ſtate, the Imperiall and the Spaniſh power combined in that houſe, by bloud and affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the Pope himſelf in his ſphaere, are both the great lights of that ſtate, and it hath pleaſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>1</label> When the wrath of GOD is kindled againſt a State for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Religion, he pours out his judgements againſt them by degrees; firſt upon the common ſort of people, then upon Church Officers, and then upon the principall Rulers and lights of that State. That is the firſt note.</p>
            <p>This is evident in the Gradation of the Text, here is the wrath of the Lord kindled againſt the Antichriſtian ſtate, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here, <hi>the earth,</hi> an earthly Kingdom, an earthly ſtate, brought forth of the earth, and minding earthly things, and all their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances ſavouring of the earth, of humane inventions, and wiſdom and power: The Lord then when his wrath is kindled, and ſends forth Meſſengers of his wrath on that State, how begin they? They begin firſt with the earth, the loweſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they begin not with the Sea, nor with the Sun, nor with the Air, but firſt the Vial fals upon the Earth: Common Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, they firſt feel the ſhame, and confuſion thereof, (as you have heretofore heard:) Then, as he diſcovers their Religion to be generally corrupt, as the bloud of a dead man; ſo hee pours out the next Vials upon the Rivers and Fountains of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thoſe that carry this Religion up and down the Countries and Nations, the Lord exaſperates Civil States ſo far againſt them, that they force them to drink bloud, their own bloud, as they made Martyrs to drink bloud; ſo the Lord gave them to drink bloud, <hi>for they are worthy,</hi> (as you heard it opened this day ſeven-night.) He firſt begins with the common Catholicks, then with Prieſts and Jeſuits: Well, doth he here ſtay, when the Lord ſees what little fruit groweth hereby? Verily no, for here is no Reformation of the common ſort, they ſtill continue in their Ignorance, and Superſtition, and Idolatry: And what are the Prieſts and Jeſuits any thing reformed? It is nothing ſo, nor do the lights of that State, either the lights of the Imperiall world, of the Provinces, or their generall and grand holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope (as they call him) none ſeek Reformation, what then? Then let the Imperiall ſtate, and Pope, that claims Lord
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:156636:58"/> Paramountſhip over all, let him look it, the next Vial fals upon his head, and the Lord doth this by degrees; firſt upon his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme luſtre and glory, as he rules by day: And the next fals upon his Throne, and that is a great blow to him; and ſtill the Lord goes on pouring to pour out, and ſtriking to ſtrike, till at length he cruſheth the man of ſin, and all his abettors. For, their religion is corrupt, and all that drink of it periſh, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, Prieſts &amp; Jeſuits ſhall ſmart; and then the Pope &amp; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, whoever are their great lights, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be lights in Church or Common-wealth, (for I will exclude neither) they both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the ſin, and ſhall partake in the puniſhment of it: The four Angels, they may be ſeverall perſons, but they have one common work, they pour Vials upon the lights of both States, and truly ſo the Lord did in Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> this is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but when <hi>Rome</hi> was once Pagan, and then became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, and under the Chriſtian Emperors, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and the reſt opened the doors of the Church ſo wide, that all the garden of God was become a wilderneſſe by an inundation of carnall people, Chriſtians in name, but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans in heart, that were let in; and then that which was once a garden incloſed, was now made a wilderneſſe, when they took down the Pale, and let in all dogs and ſwine that will come in, the wrath of God breaks out againſt them, then the Trumpet ſounds a ſhrill ſound, and what was that? In the 8 of <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. <hi>The firſt Angel ſounding, there followed hail, and fire mingled with bloud, and they were caſt upon the earth, &amp;c.</hi> and that is upon the loweſt ſort of Chriſtians, there was given grievous hail, cold hail-ſtorm, they received not the truth in love, and being cold in Chriſtianity, they were hot in Emulation and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And then the ſecond Trumpet ſounding, there was as it were a great Mountain burning caſt into the Sea, and there was a third part of the Sea became bloud; there was high prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment caſt into the Officers of the Church, and a great part of the Adminiſtrations grew corrupt. Then the third Angel ſounded, and there fals a Star from Heaven, called Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Wormwood of Hereſie, and corrupts the Prieſts; many were infected with the Hereſie of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches:</hi> Afterwards all Scriptures came to be darkned with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:156636:59"/> Allegoricall, and Hereticall, and corrupt Interpretations, that Chriſt is ſcarſe diſcerned in all their writings, and the light of Scripture is darkened, and the light of humane Learning, that there is little light left. And then the next Angel, he ſounds, and ſmoke comes out of the bottomleſſe pit, and there comes Locuſts upon the earth, and they have a King ſet over them, which is the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit, which is the Pope over the Friars and Monks. So, thus the Lord begins to deal with men, firſt he fals upon them in one degree, upon the earth firſt, and then upon Religion in them, and then upon Miniſters, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of that Religion, and after grows higher and higher, till in the end there comes the Antichriſtian ſtate, the ſeventh head, and he ſurmounts all Chriſtian Emperors, leads them all captive, and hath the Key of the bottomleſſe pit to deſtroy their ſouls, whoſe name is <hi>Abaddon</hi> in Hebrew, but in the Greeke <hi>Apollyon,</hi> and then comes the Turk in the ſixth Trumpet, and he deſtroys and ſwallows up all: So the Lords manner is, firſt he breaks forth againſt the common people, then againſt the Miniſters, then at laſt he riſeth to the great Lords of the world, the Rulers of the State, they ſmoke for it at laſt. What ſhould be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Point? The Reaſon is,</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> Firſt, becauſe ordinarily the firſt beginning of corruption is with the people, and they being firſt corrupted, then indeed it is meet that they ſhould firſt be plagued; for look as the Church grew to be corrupted in the Chriſtian Emperors time, ſo the Church came to be plagued in Antichriſtians time; the earth was firſt corrupt, in the Chriſtian Emperors time, and the firſt that is plagued, is the earth, then the ſea, then the rivers, &amp; ſo by degrees; The Lord goes the ſame way in plaguing, as they did in degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, the ſame way in executing judgement as they in ſinning.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

You read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.2 <hi>For the wickedneſſe of a land, many are the princes thereof;</hi> many and wicked Rulers too; They never lived long, nor well, after once the houſe of Iſrael had cryed out, <hi>What portion have we in David, or what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the ſon of Ieſſe?</hi> The Lord never gave them good King
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:156636:59"/> in Iſrael after, not in Iſrael I ſay, Judah indeed had ſundry times good Kings, but for Iſrael (the 10 Tribes) that rejected the yoke, and the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> in regard of the hard payments that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> ſon put upon them; and therefore in their prophaneneſſe cryed out, <hi>What portion have we in David?</hi> &amp;c. Then immediatly after that, the Lord never gave them any good King, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.16. So there grows Religion to be corrupted in the people, and then for their wickedneſſe God gives them wicked Princes; <hi>I gave them a King in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath. O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13.9, 10. Iſrael corrupts it ſelf, &amp; provokes God, and he gives them a King in his anger, and takes him away in his wrath: And it is written as a heavie curſe of God, in <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.17. <hi>If you ſtill treſpaſſe againſt me</hi> I <hi>will ſet Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces over you, that ſhall hate you:</hi> Miſchievous Princes, odious Princes that ſhall be odious to God, and malignant to the people.

In 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. you read there, the wrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To what end? That ſo a plague might come upon Iſrael: So that (minde you) how the ſins of the time riſe from the contagion of the hearts and lives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; That look as a man catcheth cold on his feet, it fils the head with diſtempers: Catch but cold in the loweſt part, about the ancles or feet; or ſuppoſe the ſtomack be ſomewhat annoyed through ill dyet, or ill digeſtion, what then? It ſtrikes up to the head preſently; you cannot annoy the feet, ancles, or middle parts, but the head will feel both: So, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters be corrupt, or common people, the head, the Rulers will ſtraightway bee corrupt, it will not bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; If the Prophets propheſie lyes, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and the people love to have it ſo, what will be the end? Do you think there will come any Princes that will reform them? Do you think the Lord will take any courſe to reform
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:156636:60"/> ſuch great evils as theſe be? As evill firſt begins with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, ſo they are firſt plagued.</p>
            <p>For a third Reaſon, As evill firſt begins with the people, and they are firſt plagued, and as for them it is derived to the Prieſts and Princes, and they are by that meanes corrupted, either are not good, or led into ſome temptation.</p>

So that (mind you) the wrath of God is carried an end in this courſe, he begins with the people firſt, becauſe they are firſt corrupt, and then with Rulers, for had not they been ſoon corrupted, it had not been poſſible that the Church ſhould ſo quickly have become a wilderneſſe. So here he begins with the common ſort, and then with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and then with the great Lights that rule by day, that rules the affaires of the Church and Common-wealth.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156636:61"/> the Miniſters of the Goſpell muſt looke to it, for the next thing will bee ſome heavy judgment or other God will bring upon them if they be not vigilant to ſee that all things bee done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true platforme left to us in the word: you know the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> complaines of it in <hi>Malac.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. that men began to waxe weary of ſacrifices, and ſnuffed at the coſt of it, and brought the blinde and lame, and any thing for Sacrifice, and the Table of the Lord was polluted, and what then And now (ſaith the Lord) O yee Prieſts this Commandement is for you, in the firſt verſe of the ſecond Chapter (it is a very ſad word which the Lord ſpeaks) if you will not heare and lay it to heart; what ſhould they lay to heart? This hailſtone Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the people, this ſnuffing at the Ordinances if you lay not this to heart, I will ſend a curſe upon you, and will curſe your bleſſings, yea, I have curſed them already, becauſe you doe not lay it to heart, and I will corrupt your ſeed, &amp;c. in the 1, 2, 3, verſe, and ſo he goes on very ſadly in threatning the Miniſters of God upon this point: The people corrupted their wayes, and were weary of holy duties, cold hearted, and only quick for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and diviſion; and what then? becauſe the Miniſters of God doe not beſtirre them, the Lord brings a curſe upon their bleſſings, their beſt gifts in heart, and outward bleſſings, he blaſts both, and therefore it marveilouſly concernes Miniſters to be moſt tender this way, to ſee that all be carried exactly according to the word of God.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:156636:61"/> helpe you not to continue watchfull in this kind: It is true there is an order to looke to all corruption in doctrine, and worſhip, and government that are ſtirring in the Countrey: And it is true, matters of religion are firſt and properly conſiderable in the Churches themſelves, by the officers and brethren of the Church: But if Magiſtrates ſhall find Brethren or Officers defective, or neglective, it will be their parts to give free paſſage to all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings for redreſſe, and if any thing come to your cognizance before it come to the Church, then it will concerne you to ſtirre up the Church to looke to doctrine, worſhip, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and you will find in this caſe you will deliver your ſoules from danger, and Church-officers and people too, otherwiſe you ſee the danger of corruption in religion; if the earth be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, the ſea will be corrupt, and the rivers and fountaines, and the Sunne wil be corrupt, and all alike more or leſſe afflicted and plagued of God, for toleration of ſuch evils as are found amongſt them.

This is that King <hi>Ahaz:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, brand him for an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite and a reprobate, that in his diſtreſſe treſpaſſeth yet more, why? for he went and ſacrificed to the gods of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> which ſmote him, becauſe the gods of the kings of <hi>Syria</hi> help them, &amp;c. In ſtead of humbling himſelf under Gods hand to give him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he breaks forth into blaſphemy, and hardens his heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents not to give him glory, but waxes more fierce againſt the Lord, to blaſpheme.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Firſt, it may report to you from the Oracle of God, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Popiſh State is going faſt to perdition, and the great lights of that State, both the lights of that State, great like the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:156636:62"/> Sun in the firmament, be they Civil Magiſtrates in their ſphaere, in higheſt place; or take it as the Popiſh Prelacie do, they will be higheſt in both kindes, be it as it will be, as the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been viſited with judgement, their Religion corrupt, and Prieſts and Jeſuits plagued, and the Lord hath begun to plague their lights in this world, and Church lights too: So make account of this, foraſmuch as <hi>they repent not to give God glory,</hi> but break forth to greater wrath, and outrage againſt the Lord and his Church, and ſervants, and ſecret ones, what will the end of all this be? Never did any man ſtrive againſt God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered; what, under the mighty hand of God, under the Vials of Gods wrath, and ſtill blaſpheme the name of God, and ſtill hope to proſper? Verily you may write upon it, God wil wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch as go on ſtill in their wickedneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.21. Let them look to it, the Lord hath begun to pour out his wrath, and one Vial hath not done when another begins to work, but they are pouring upon the common people, and upon Prieſts and Jeſuits, and will be more and more, and ſo ſhall both the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Pope himſelf, in their ſupremacie and lordly authority; and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may have ſome refreſhing, and ſuccour, and ſupply in their declining ſtate, yet as their apoſtacies and backſlidings are perpetuall, as the Text ſaith they are, ſeeing <hi>they repent not to give God glory,</hi> the Lord hath ſet it down, (and the Scripture muſt be fulfilled) they will go on in their rage and blaſphemie againſt the God of Iſrael, and what will the iſſue of that be? Truly, if men proſper in hardneſſe of heart and blaſphemy, then let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> proſper of old, and let all wicked States proſper; but the Lord ſent judgement upon judgement, upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> firſt upon the waters, and then upon the fruits of the field, at length he came to Murrain of the Beaſts, and then a plague upon their firſt-born; and when that ſerved not, then the wrath of God came upon the red Sea, and over-whelmed them all: This is Gods manner of dealing, and let the Imperiall State, and all blaſphemers know it, that they ſhall not proſper in ſtouting it out againſt the Lord, but (believe it) as they have begun to fall before reformed Churches, ſo they ſhall ſurely fall: As it was told <hi>Haman</hi> in <hi>Eſter</hi> 6.13. <hi>If this Mordecai be of the ſeed of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:156636:63"/> Iews, before whom thou haſt begun to fall, thou ſhalt not prevail, but ſhalt ſurely fall before him:</hi> So fall they will, and in falling they ſhall fall, and yet more and more fall, till the Lord hath cut them off, root &amp; branch: there is more judgments, you ſhall read of a further Vial upon the throne of the Beaſt, and upon the air, and then <hi>Babilon</hi> is fallen, it is not long till then, there is but three Vials more, and whether ſome of them be not yet begun to be poured out, it is not yet ſo cleer: Let them know it for their terrour, and we for our comfort, the Lord will go on in deſtroying to deſtroy them. It is a ſpeech the Lord often uſeth, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9.12, 13, 14. <hi>Yet for all this his anger is not turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill:</hi> Why? For the people turn not to him that ſmites them, neither do they ſeek the Lord of hoaſts; and when they do not turn to him, then the hand of the Lord is not drawn back, but ſtretched out ſtill: that is the conſtant courſe of Gods providence, as the people turn not to him that ſmites them, ſo the Lord will go on, and cut off head and tail, branch and ruſh in one day, ancient, honorable, he is the head; and the Prophet that teacheth lyes, hee is the tail, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For a ſecond Uſe of this Point,</p>
            <p>This may ſerve to teach us, that the Lord is the chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> and hath the chief power of all the plagues and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that do fall upon men: And that aggravates the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of theſe wicked men, that they do not fall under his hand that hath power over theſe plagues, but ſtill go on hardning themſelves againſt him whoſe plague is upon them. Therefore he hath power over them, and he will maintain it, and the judgements ſhall go on deſtroying to deſtroy, till like Vials of quick-ſilver they have rooted them out from the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: <hi>Is there any evil in the City, which the Lord hath not done?</hi> Amos 3.6. If a man were to ſpeak to Chriſtian Princes in other parts, how might a man call upon them, to beware of timerouſneſſe, and fear, in provoking the diſpleaſure of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> or of the Pope? For the wrath of God is gone out againſt that State, and the Pope, and the Lord hath power over theſe plagues: Why ſhould we fear all the power of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> or Papall thunderbolts, when the Lord
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:156636:63"/> hath you under his hand, when he means to go on plaguing to plague? Shall men underprop this rotten building which the Lord intends to deſtroy? This curſed fabrick which the Lord will ruinate? Do you think to ſtrengthen your ſelves by them, when they are not able to help themſelves? No, it is a time of Gods plague; and therefore it is a warning and Trumpet to all Chriſtian nations, and to us, do not think if we ſhall not yield to this and that of Antichriſt, then Churches and Magiſtrates ſhall never ſubſiſt, fear it not; I tell you, all the States that cleave to Popery, ſhall fall with Popery, if they continue in it: Indeed if the Lord reſcue and redeem them with a mighty hand, and bow their power and Crown, to comply with the Lord Jeſus and his people, they may ſave themſelves and their Kingdoms; but otherwiſe it is not poſſible for them to proſper, in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ruinous <hi>Babylon</hi> that haſtens to deſtruction. The Lords plagues they are, and it is not all the power of men, or Princes, no nor of Angels in heaven, nor devils in hell, that can take off the plagues that God hath ſet on.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it teacheth us what is the duty of all the ſons of men <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> under Gods hand, namely to repent of ſin, which hath brought Gods hand, for this is an aggravation of the wickedneſſe of theſe lights, that they repented not to give God glory, when the vials of Gods wrath was upon them, but ſtil grew more wicked, even to blaſpheme: What ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter? Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. Hath the Lord begun to ſmite the common ſtate, and it may be the body of the countrey, in that which is the ſinewes of trading, in the ſcarcities of moneyes? Brethren do you think it is not a judgement of God? Is not the ſilver and gold his? and hath he it not for this ſtate as well as for others, if we had not ſome wayes provoked him? Did he not take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them in <hi>Hagge,</hi> when they neglected Temple work? And did not he ſay, <hi>The ſilver and gold is mine,</hi> 1 <hi>Hag.</hi> 6. and 2 <hi>Hag.</hi> 6.7, 8? Hath not the Lord blaſted us, becauſe we grew cold hearted, and formall in Church-fellowſhip, and confident, and warme, and bold-hearted in matters pertaining to our ſelves and to the world, and in matters that tended onely to tumult? What then? In ſuch a caſe marvell not, if the Lord ſend forth a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:156636:64"/> Vial of his wrath upon us, and curſe our bleſſings, that that which within theſe 4, or 5, years was but a drug, and men would not labour for money, they would have corne, and be glad of it, they would have proviſions. Now proviſions are a drug, Beef and Butter, it is not currant now, men will give no money for it, they will not part with it: Is it not a Vial of his wrath, or at leaſt a twig of his rod? And is it not meet now to repent, and give him glory, that hath power over this plague, that we be not ſenſleſſe, and obdurate? And doth not the Lord ſay he will curſe our bleſſings, he ſaith ſo to Miniſters, and will any be free? Will any proſper when they lay not Gods hand to heart, but make a trifling buſineſſe of it? but make account the Lord calls men to ſerious conſideration of it.</p>

It is lively ſet forth in the Text (I might be large herein) they repented not to give God glory: So there is the proper act of repentance, when it runnes right, in a right chanell, it gives God glory: What glory doth it give God? Firſt, it gives him the glory of his Soveraignty, the Text is plain, as <hi>They gave not glory to God that hath power over theſe plagues;</hi> they are Gods plagues, and he hath power to ſend them, and we ſee his hand in them, his plagues they are, and that is the firſt thing in repentance, to ſee it is the hand of God in this kind, and that kind, in any kind that may befall us, Give God the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his ſoveraignty, who hath ſent theſe plagues, and this will help us to repentance.</p>

            <p>This Scripture and the interpretation of it, is the more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, becauſe it is generally conceived that the execution of Gods judgements upon the Beaſt, hath not yet gone beyond the powring out of the fourth Viall, therefore conjectures about it, will be the more difficult, and it may be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine: yet becauſe the Scripture in it ſelfe is not darke, how darke ſo ever we may be in our apprehenſions: The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Beaſt is darke, but not the Kingdome of Chriſt. And the Lord hath promiſed a gracious bleſſing upon all that read, and heare the words of this prophecy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. ſo that by the comparing of one part of this prophecy with another, and obſerving the due poiſe of every word in his place, with holy feare and reverence, the Lord is wont to lead his people into truth, according to the promiſe made to the Apoſtle, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13. (which is fulfilled to every ſucceſſour of theirs in ſome meaſure) Let us therefore goe on in the feare of God to conſider of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Firſt the difficulty chiefely lyeth in opening the ſubject whereon this Viall will be powred, for open that, and the reſt will be cleare. The ſeat of the Beaſt is generally taken for the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and it is confirmed from the like ſpeech, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. Where the <hi>Dragon</hi> gave the Beaſt his power, and his ſeat, (or throne) and great authority, and therefore they gather from hence the ruine of <hi>Rome,</hi> applying alſo hereunto ſome prophecies of the <hi>Sibills,</hi> who in their Language tell us thus much, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall then be deſolate, and be as if it had never been a ſtate. Now though we have much cauſe to glorifie God for the labours of ſuch of his ſervants as have give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that expoſition, yet I muſt confeſſe I cannot reſt ſatisfied with that interpretation: for I finde it cleare in the ſequell of this Chapter, that <hi>Babilon</hi> (which is doubtleſſe meant of <hi>Rome [As throughout the ſeventeenth Chapter it is alſo]</hi> is ſaid to come up into Remembrance before God in the 19. <hi>verſe</hi> of this Chapter, And that is in the powring out the ſeventh <hi>Viall;</hi> which implyeth that before, it came not up in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance before God in point of actuall puniſhment, for things are ſaid to come up into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>brance before God, when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156636:67"/> he taketh in hand either to ſhew mercy to them, or to powre out wrath upon them, a ſigne that the <hi>Viall</hi> and fierceneſſe of his wrath was not yet powred out upon <hi>Rome:</hi> beſides it is expreſſed in this Text, that upon the powring out of this <hi>Viall,</hi> the Kingdome of the beaſt was darkened, but there is a great difference betweene darkning, and deſtroying; <hi>Egypt</hi> was darkened, before <hi>Pharoh</hi> was deſtroyed, or the body of <hi>Egypt</hi> overwhelmed in the red Sea. Upon theſe grounds therefore I cannot conceive that it is meant of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of ſomething elſe, which in Scripture is to be underſtood by <hi>[Throne]</hi> ſometimes it is put for that forme of government and authority which any perſon or ſtate ſitting on that throne doth adminiſter, as it is ſaid of Chriſt, that his throne is a throne of Righteouſneſſe, and that is not ſo much ſpoken of the place where he governeth, as of the government it ſelfe, ſo in the 89 <hi>Pſalme</hi> 29. &amp; 36, 37. I will make his throne as the dayes of Heaven, and againe his throne ſhall be as the Sunne before me; It ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever as the Moone, and in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 122.5. Thrones of judgement are diſtinguiſhed from the thrones of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> to wit, ſuch as <hi>David</hi> hath erected: ſo by the like propoſition it is here meant of that forme of government, which the beaſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth in the Church both ſubjectively, that which himſelfe doth occupy over the Churches ſubject to him, and effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which proceedeth from him, and is exerciſed by others in other Churches according to the frame and forme of government received from him, and that is ſuch a peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe kind of government, as wherein one alone doth rule; for a throne is ſuch a kind of ſeate wherein one of peereleſſe authority doth governe; as a Monarch in his owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
            <p>Indeed the univerſall ſupremacy of the <hi>Pope</hi> both in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall things, whereby he challengeth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent authority over all Kings and Princes, that was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the fourth <hi>Viall</hi> of theſe Angels: but yet ſtill here is another throne which yet hitherto remaineth unplagued, and that is his <hi>ſingular ſole</hi> authority, and monarchicall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby he ſitteth chiefe and onely Judge in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall cauſes in his own juriſdiction, and like unto which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156636:68"/> he hath eſtabliſhed the government of all National, Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Dioceſan Churches, and ſo this interpretation doth very fitly ſuit with the proper effect of the powring out of this <hi>Viall</hi> expreſſed in the Text <hi>[his Kingdome was darkened]</hi>

Though it be ſaid this <hi>Viall</hi> is not yet powred out, and though it haply was not powred out with the writings of ſuch men (who ſo conceived) were under their hands: yet <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Cartwright</hi> did ſprinkle ſome drops of this <hi>Viall</hi> upon this government, though the power and ſtrength of the Epiſcopacy in their time was ſuch as drunke them up like the dry Earth, that drinketh in the raine; yet will not God be ſo put off from his word, he powreth out more drops upon them by holy <hi>Baines</hi> his triall of Dioceſan go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and godly learned <hi>Parkers</hi> Eccleſiaſticall Politie, but theſe were drops: you now ſee whole <hi>Vialls</hi> full of wrath powred out by the whole Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves, and their ſtate for ever in this quarrell, and have beene carried along herein, not in a way of popular tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, but with ſuch wiſedome, courage, judgement and Piety, that you may ſee and ſay that it is not a <hi>Viall</hi> powred out by an unadviſed multitude, but by an Angell of God, by the Heavenly Miniſters of his wrath.</p>
            <p>It hath beene taken in hand with ſerious and deepe and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall humiliation, judging themſelves for their toleration of ſuch a government amongſt themſelves, and ſo ſeconded in their conſtant fruits of Reformation, as that their very
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156636:68"/> adverſaries ſtand amazed to behold them, and theſe are not drops alone, but like unto great ground ſhowers which grow unto a floud and overflow all for they have turned away the floud of ſuperſtition in their owne Country, by the Rivers of the power of God, and his Evangelicall truth, ſo now they have alſo flowed into <hi>England,</hi> inſomuch that a great many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England</hi> and many noble Peeres, doe begin to ſay that Epiſcopacy is an antichriſtian frame and forme, which he brought in, and doth ſtill countenance and animate, and while it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth, popery will not fall: whereupon, It hath come to paſſe (if your intelligences faile not) that many ſad conſiderations have beene taken up in <hi>England,</hi> whether it be not beſt to abandon all ſuch thrones: men will not fight for the defence of theſe thrones, nor draw their purſes to maintaine ſuch warre, but men begin generally to be taught of God, that this is not the forme of the government of Jeſus Chriſt.

            <p>And for the third event <hi>[They repented not of their deeds]</hi> have they no cauſe thinke you to repent of all their oppreſſions and tyrannies over godly men, through many ages? for that their governments have been formidable to none but the peaceable men of the Land: if it be a drunkard or ſome baſe fellow that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to their Courts, they ſay to him, what doeſt thou here thou ſimple fellow? pay thy fees, and be gone: but for the people of God, nothing will ſatisfie but their extirpation from their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, livings and dwellings; they ſhall not be allowed to breath in the free aire, if any priſon in the Countrey will hold them. And is it not to be repented of the invaſions of the liberties of Church, and of civill liberties which have beene by ſome of them deſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impeached, ſo as that neither ſubject nor Prince ſhall know what belongeth to either of them; and ſome of the throne of the beaſt will tell you, that betweene Prince and ſubject there is no <hi>meum, &amp; tuum,</hi> but the Prince may ſay <hi>omne meum,</hi> are not theſe things to be repented of? And is there no ſuperſtition to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of? And have they repented of theſe things? doth any ſemblance of repentance appeare? have they not ſtill gone an end, even while this <hi>Viall</hi> hath beene in powring out to put new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions upon Gods people? have they not impoſed an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Oath, that this is the onely government, and that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe acknowledge nor ever will acknowledge any other, and is not this a blaſphemy againſt the name and Crowne of Chriſt Jeſus? and yet they repent not of theſe deeds: therefore they have ſaid not much amiſſe, that ſaid that all the miſchiefes that have ſprung up in any ſtate in the World, where theſe thrones have beene ſet up, have ſprung from them that ſate upon theſe thrones. Thus you ſee what is the true and ſimple meaning of theſe words, and I durſt not have ſpoken it, but that no other interpretation will well abide by the words of the Text. <hi>Babilon</hi> will not abide it, for that commeth up into remembrance in the ſeventh <hi>Viall;</hi> doe but conſider all things together, and weigh the words of the Text well with what goeth before, and with what will follow after by the helpe of God, and you ſhall find this to be the true meaning. Nevertheleſſe though theſe former and late attempts againſt Epiſcopacy may bee the beginning of this <hi>Viall,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156636:71"/> ſome good meaſure alſo of the powring it forth, you may believe that it will not reſt here, but as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4.

            <p>That forme of government, wherein one by ſole and ſingular <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> authority doth govern the Church ſpecially many Churches and moſt of all, all Churches doth ſpring from the Earth and ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of the Earth, for ſo it appeareth to be from the Text, for all theſe Angels powred out their <hi>Vialls</hi> upon the Earth: <hi>Verſe</hi> 1. Not as Earth is oppoſed to other elements, but as it is oppoſed to Heaven: ſo that as their Earth is earthly, ſo is their Sea, and their Rivers, and Fountaines, and their Sunne: and this throne is but an earthly throne, you ſee no ſuch throne in the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony opened in Heaven: ſo farre as Churches are Heavenly, theſe thrones are not ſet up in them: for this is it which <hi>Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooveth (3. <hi>Io.</hi> 9.) in Diotrephes, that he loveth to be a primate and would not regard a letter from <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe though an Apoſtle; &amp; for the brethren he would not receive them himſelf, and forbad them that would, and caſt them out of the Church, the true ſpirit of an earthly Primate, for they ſavour of earthly ambition and covetouſneſſe, love <hi>Balaams</hi> wages, they ſtick not to buy their places for ſilver, care not what they give for them, but having gotten them with buying, they muſt maintaine them by ſelling, they muſt ſell Ordinations and Abſolutions, and Diſpenſations, and muſt be maintained by the benevolences of their obedient Clergy, and in truth the ſumme of the matter is, <hi>quid mihi dabis?</hi> and what is all this but earthly bravery, if ever you have beene at their thrones (though it were but the thrones of their chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156636:72"/> and Officialls) you ſhall ſee nothing but that which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth of the Earth, earthly pride, or pleaſure or Covetouſneſſe, I am, (and have leſſe cauſe then many others from my laſt Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan, who being more learned, was more ingenuous and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then many others) not wont to ſpeake theſe things, yet when the neceſſity of clearing my Text leadeth me to them, I may not without unfaithfullneſſe to God and his Church, keepe ſilence, we came not hither to ſpeake hardly of other Churches: but when the Word of God calleth for it, we ſhould be wickedly ſilent if we ſhould not let the people know, what the mercy and bleſſing is, which we doe enjoy, and what we are delivered from.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rea. </seg>1</label> The firſt Reaſon of the Doctrine is from that forme of Church eſtate, which Chriſt hath inſtituted in his Word, which is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the government of a Church of a particular viſible Congregation; He owneth no other, nor giveth any government to any beſides them. <hi>If thy brother offend thee, goe and tell the Church,</hi> and muſt the offence ſtay till all the world be gathered together; or if it were meant of one Dioceſan or provinciall Church, when will they meete? therefore the Church that muſt heare al offences is the Church of a particular Congregation, which may all of them meete together in one place (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23.) and then though offences come thicke, they may all be orderly heard and remooved. And conſider moreover (that which further cleares up this firſt ground) what variety of officers God hath given to this Church, not many Pariſhes to one Biſhop, but many Biſhops to one Church, ſo as that <hi>Paul</hi> writteth to the Saints at <hi>Philippi, with the Biſhops and Deacons, Phil.</hi> 1.1. And he ſendeth for the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus Acts</hi> 20.17. Whom he calleth Biſhops <hi>Verſe</hi> 28. <hi>And they were more then one in every Church, according to Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>They ordained them Elders in every Church,</hi> directly contrary to the practiſe of the Lord Biſhops of theſe dayes; Theſe things we ſpeake, that the people may know we ſet forth no new inventions, though it be true that there is a newneſſe in all the bleſſings of the new Teſtament, whereas all the inventions of men wax old as doth a garment, and there is no new thing under the ſunne, as touching mens inventions, but they will grow old and vaniſh away, as all Dioceſin Churches will doe, which the Lord hath not inſtituted: Though indeed in the old Common wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Church was Nationall, and there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156636:72"/> was but one high Prieſt who was a type of Chriſt, but now Chriſt is come he hath delivered all his counſell to his 12. Apoſtles, and they have left the ordering of his Church to ſome paſtors, and ſome teachers and ſome ruling Elders, and ſome Deacons. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe the Goſpel knoweth no other.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ground is taken from the kinde of power which <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rea. </seg>2</label> God hath given to his officers in his Churches, hath he given to them a Lordly or a Miniſteriall power? ſurely no Lordly power, neither over their fellow Elders nor over the Church, <hi>But he hath in his Word prohibited both theſe. Math.</hi> 20.25, 26, 27. <hi>The Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them, &amp; they that are great exerciſe authority upon them, but it ſhall not be ſo amongſt you, but whoſoever will be great amongſt you let him be your Miniſter, and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be cheife amongſt you let him be your ſervant.</hi> Amongſt the Officers of Chriſt honour is carried by the moſt labour, and not by moſt outward ſplendor: But thoſe that ſit upon the throne of of the Beaſt doe not labour in any kinde of government but that, which is merely antichriſtian, to foment ſin and let looſe the reines of all prophaneſſe: neither doe the officers which Chriſt hath ſet in his Church reach after outward honour, but the cheife of them make themſelves equall with them of the lower ſort, as <hi>Peter</hi> (though an Apoſtle) when he writeth to the Elders <hi>ſtileth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a fellow Elder</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. <hi>and exhorteth them to feed the flock of God, not as Lords over Gods heritage, but being examples to the flock; ſo the Apoſtle in his ſecond and third Epiſtle ſtileth himſelfe an Elder,</hi> ſo farre is he from affecting Lordly authority: by all which we may ſee that all this kinde of Lordly, and ſtately government is no way compatible to that government, which Chriſt hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Church.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon is taken from that authority which the Lord <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rea. </seg>3</label> hath given to every Church over their Biſhops, as well as to their Biſhops over them, which cannot ſtand with Epiſcopall ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aignty, <hi>It is true, the Lord hath given them power over the Church, let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. A power they have to call the Church together, as the Apoſtles did for the choiſe of Deacons, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2. And to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the doores of ſpeech, and ſhut the doores of ſilence, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15. A power they have alſo to diſmiſſe the aſſembly as they ſee cauſe, for they that begin they alſo make an end, and ſend away the people with a bleſſing, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.24, 25, 26. Power they have to

And ſundry branches of rule may be deduced out of theſe: yet as true it is alſo that the Lord hath given power to the Church over their Rulers, as firſt to chooſe them, they ordained them Elders by lifting up their hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. And when there was an Apoſtle to be choſen in <hi>Iudas</hi> his roome, they out of an 120 perſons choſe two men, and preſented them to the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.23. Secondly they have power to ſend them forth about the Churches ſervice, as they ſent <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem, Acts</hi> 15.2. And without controverſie he that ſendeth is greater then he whom he ſendeth, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 13.16. Secondly they have power to admoniſh them, if they doe offend, <hi>ſay to Archippus, take heed to they Miniſtery, &amp;c. Col.</hi> 4.17. And the Church contended with <hi>Peter</hi> for eating with the heathen, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.2, 3. And had he not given them the better anſwer, they would have proceeded againſt him: Theſe things then laid together, what a beaſtly power is that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of ſuch as imitate them, as uſurpe authority, and judgement over ſo many Churches, and will be judged by none?</p>

Juſt care is taken that there be no robbery nor pilfering, no oppreſſions, no violation of any mans bed, nothing taken up but it ſhall be duely paid for, and yet the proceeding made with ſuch conſtancy, that (in a way of humility) the end muſt be attained, or elſe there wil be no place in the concluſion.

Thus ſtandeth the Text.</p>
            <p>Now for the meaning of it: It is the more darke, becauſe it is, (though not altogether) yet in a great part to come; and ſuch as ſhall ſeriouſly conſider what is the meaning ſhal (happily) find it no ſmall difficulty to ſatiſfy themſelves, and much more to ſatisfy others, yet (by the helpe of God) let us endeavour to open ſome ſuch part of the words, as we may be likely to finiſh at this time. Firſt what is meant by the river <hi>Euphrates?</hi> Secondly, who are the Angels that powre out this <hi>Viall</hi> upon this river? Thirdly, what is the drying up of this river? Fourthly, who are theſe Kings of the Eaſt? Theſe things containe the principall difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the partes of this <hi>Viall,</hi> other things may more eaſily be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, if theſe things be premiſed and cleared.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by the great river <hi>Euphrates:</hi> Some of our hoſt interpreters (to whom God hath given moſt light in theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall myſteries) doe underſtand it, properly for the river that did run along by the walles of old Babylon in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> which made the City impregnable, and yet by the ſtratagem of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was dryed up, by turning the Courſe of the ſtreames to runne in other
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156636:76"/> channels, whereby the channell before the City was dryed up; and the reedes burnt by the Souldiers, and the City ſacked when as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was quaffing in the veſſels of the Temple: this was foretold by <hi>Jeremy</hi> Chap 50.38. <hi>A drought is upon her waters, and they ſhall be dried up, for it is the Land of graven Images, and they are mad upon their Idolls. And Ier.</hi> 51.31, 32. <hi>One poſte ſhall run to meete another, and one meſſenger to meete another, to ſhew the King of Babylon that his City is taken at an end, and that the paſſages are ſtopped, and the reedes they have burnt with fire, &amp;c.</hi> Now they that interprete <hi>Euphrates</hi> to be the ſame river, doe underſtand that when God calleth home his ancient people, he will dry up <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> before them, ſo that they may aſſault the Turkiſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and recover their ancient inheritance out of his hand. The reaſon which they give of it is, 1. Becauſe they read of no Nation for whom God dryed up any rivers but onely for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for whom he dryed up the red Sea, and the waters of <hi>Jordan.</hi> 2. They ſay it hath been anciently foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.27. &amp; 51.10. &amp; 63.11. In all which places God is deſcribed to have dryed up the waters, and rivers for them, that as a pledge of the like power to be manifeſted for them hereafter. 3. (Say they) the prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> (<hi>Chap</hi> 59.20. alledged by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 11.26.) foretelleth the calling of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> and if this <hi>Viall</hi> ſpeake not of their calling, it is ſpoken of no where in this booke, which is not credible.</p>
            <p>Now although their reaſons are not to be ſlighted, yet they doe not ſeeme to carry force enough to underſtand <hi>Euphrates</hi> literally, for Gods Hand may as well be ſeene in drying up the metaphoricall rivers; Beſides, <hi>Iſay</hi> 44.27. Doth properly ſpeake of Gods drying up the river <hi>Euphrates</hi> before <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which was then to come, but is not meant of this drying up in the Text, which is to be many hundred yeares after, and for the two other places mentioned, <hi>Iſay</hi> 51.10. &amp; 63.11. They only recount what God had done for their Fathers of old, whereupon they deſire that he would not forſake them now, and ſo they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of as ancient paſſages of his power for them, but not as promiſes what he would doe for them afterward: Save onely as encouragements to their Faith, to expect great deliverances from the ſame hand.</p>
            <p>And for the third reaſon: It is not neceſſary that it ſhould be foretold in this <hi>Viall,</hi> or elſe not foretold in this booke: for the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:156636:76"/> whole 21, and 22 Chapters of this booke doe hold it forth, which are events of the powring forth of the ſeventh <hi>Viall,</hi> and not of this ſixth.</p>
            <p>If then it be not meant of the naturall river, <hi>Euphrates,</hi> of what then may it be underſtood? There are ſome that underſtand it of ſomething that is unto <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Euphrates</hi> was to old <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> I ſhall tel you what I moſt incline unto, as far as the Text will permit.</p>
            <p>Some ſay it is meant of Nations, and Tongues, and People, and Languages, for they are ſometimes underſtood by waters: but <hi>Euphrates</hi> is but one river among many, and therefore why ſhould it be meant of many Nations that ſhould fall off from <hi>Rome?</hi> I cannot well cloſe with that, nor is it neceſſary that <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſhould be a name given to any one Nation, unleſſe it were ſome one that might lie neere <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which no Chriſtian Nation doth. And others there are that doe underſtand by it another reſemblance, as it was a meanes to convey much maintenance to old <hi>Babylon,</hi> and therefore conceive it meaneth all the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> whereby he is made rich, and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; now Chriſtian Kings ſhall dry up this river <hi>Euphrates</hi> by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away this kind of maintenance, and ſo by theſe Kings of the Eaſt they underſtand thoſe Chriſtian Kings, that ſhall take away theſe revenewes; but neither can I well cloſe with that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for you may conſider it, that all theſe ſeven <hi>Vialls</hi> are ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſeven Trumpets, though they fall out in different ages of that Church: The ſeven Trumpets brought in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> and theſe <hi>Vialls</hi> are the plagues of God upon thoſe very corruptions, which the Trumpets brought in: Now you ſhall finde that the effect of the ſounding of the ſixth Trumpet was, there were foure Angels looſed which were bound in the great river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> Angels were ready with an Army of two hundred thouſand thouſand; and they by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent of all interpreters, are to be underſtood of the foure Families of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> that were bound by ſome incumbrances at the river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> but afterward broke fourth upon all Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endome, and got <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> into their hands, and overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all <hi>Aſia.</hi> And beſides to underſtand the Kings of the Eaſt to be the 10 Chriſtian Kings will not accord, for they are not ſeated Eaſt from <hi>Rome,</hi> or if ſome of them be, yet nothing neere the number of ten. Therefore there be that ſay, that the river <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:156636:77"/> doth here meane the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominion, and that this river <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſhall be dryed up by the power of the Kings of the Eaſt, whom they interpret to be the <hi>Iewes,</hi> (and I would not hinder that) thereby to make way for the recovery of their Land; And true it is that <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the firſt Trumpet did ſignify the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> power that lay by that river: In like manner it is expounded of the <hi>Aſſirian</hi> monarchy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.7. <hi>When the Lord bringeth upon them the waters of the river ſtrong and many, even the King of Aſſyria, and all his glory, and he ſhall come over his channels, and overflow all his bankes, becauſe they refuſed the helpe which God had given them at home.</hi> Now that <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> which then the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy had in dominion, is at this day poſſeſſed by the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and if the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy may be reſembled unto it, ſo may the Turkiſh alſo: this commeth neereſt to the Text, yet I cannot ſay that altogether it ſuteth with the context, nor that this ſixt Angel ſhould be meant of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> And let me give you ſome reaſons, why it cannot be the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that muſt powre out this <hi>Viall,</hi> nor that the drying up of <hi>Euphrates</hi> can be meant only of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monarchy, though they alſo ſhall be plagued by the drying of it up.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that the ſixth Angel cannot be the <hi>Iewes</hi> appeareth from what is ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>ult.</hi> That no man was able to enter into the Temple till the ſeven plagues of the 7 Angels were fulfilled, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Iewes</hi> cannot come into the viſible Church in the time of this ſixth <hi>Viall,</hi> till the ſeventh be powred out. But certaine it is theſe Angels who powre out the <hi>Vialls,</hi> doe all of them come out of the Temple,) and are cloathed in pure, and white linnen, having their breſts girded with golden girdles, therefore they are al profeſſours of the truth, and ſincere profeſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is evident in the Text, that the way of the <hi>Iewes</hi> is prepared, by the powring out of this <hi>Viall.</hi> And therefore they are not this Angell who powre out this <hi>Viall,</hi> but have a way prepared, onely for their Converſion, as an effect of this <hi>Viall.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, all the Subjects whereupon theſe <hi>Vialls</hi> are powred are ſuch againſt which the wrath of God is kindled: for they are the <hi>Vialls</hi> of the wrath of God that are powred: and they are all powred upon the Earth, by which is meant the antichriſtian ſtate, and ſuch things therein againſt which Gods wrath is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Now the anger of God is not kindled againſt the river
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:156636:77"/> 
               <hi>Euphrates</hi> more then againſt any other river, his wrath falles not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rivers, though ſometimes for mans ſake it may; but <hi>Euphrates</hi> lieth not neere to the <hi>Romane</hi> antichriſt, nor to any ſtate ſubject to him. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would you ſay? is it not moſt likely to hould forth the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominion? which God is angry with? Shall not Chriſtian Princes powre out the wrath of God upon the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions?

Againe ſuppoſe the Kings of the Eaſt be the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as they are more then probably conceived by enterpreters; yet they cannot be the Angell that powred out this <hi>Viall:</hi> For the Angel that powred out this <hi>Viall</hi> he dries up the waters, and makes way for their comming in, therefore it is not they that powred out this <hi>Viall.</hi>

            <p>Yee have heard that the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> cannot be properly meant of that River <hi>Euphrates</hi> that watered old <hi>Babell;</hi> becauſe the wrath of God is not upon materiall Rivers, and Fountaines of waters, but onely upon ſuch perſons as dwell neare them, or may be watered by them: but the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver it ſelfe cannot be it. It is not taken here for one of thoſe Rivers and Fountaines of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which were turned into bloud, in the 18 <hi>Verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> by the third Angell: for then if it had been ſo underſtood the wrath of God had been powred upon him in the third <hi>Viall,</hi> not in this ſixth. The rivers there meant are ſuch popiſh Emiſſaries, and Prieſts, as doe carry the popiſh Doctrine up and downe the Country; now <hi>Euphrates</hi> waſhed <hi>Babylon;</hi> and his rivers are dried up when <hi>Babylon</hi> is taken: now <hi>Babylon</hi> comes to be taken, and deſtroyed in the next <hi>Viall,</hi> not in the ſixth <hi>Viall,</hi> as ſome have hertofore taken it: But <hi>Euphrates</hi> therefore being that which watered the City of old <hi>Babell,</hi> it muſt be ſomething that doth the like office unto this new <hi>Babell,</hi> unto <hi>Rome:</hi> that waters the throne of the Beaſt; that waters the ſeat of antichriſt. And yet (mind ye) ſo waters it, that if the waters thereof be dried up, there is way made for the Kings of the Eaſt to come in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently way made for the ruine of the Turkiſh Empire, and Monarchy; For as yee heard theſe ſeven <hi>Vialls</hi> come in, in order as the ſeven Trumpets did; to remove the ſeven judgements they brought in; looke how the ſeven Trumpets ſounded, and by their ſounding brought in ſeverall graduall judgements, ſo juſt in the ſame order are theſe <hi>Vialls</hi> powred out, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer judgements removed. As the firſt Trumpet brought a plague upon the Earth, ſo the firſt Angell powred out a <hi>Viall</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, to remove that plague. The ſecond Trumpet ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought a judgement upon the Sea; The ſecond Angell powers out his <hi>Viall</hi> upon the Sea; and ſo the reſt: The ſixth Trumpet (as yee heard) let looſe the foure Angells, the foure Turkiſh Families bound by the river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which brought in the Turkiſh apoſtacy, and tyranny into the World. This <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> is ſuch a river as waters <hi>Babell;</hi> and the drying it up did of old make way for the ruine of <hi>Babell.</hi> So will the drying up of this <hi>Euphrates</hi> dry up the force, and ſtrength of the new <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> and ſo of the Turkiſh tyranny alſo. In one word, yee have heard, that which hath been the ſtrength and fence of the Turkiſh Dominion hath been the ſtreames of corruption and falſe worſhip
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:156636:83"/> in the <hi>Babiloniſh,</hi> for ſo yee read in the ninth Chapter of this booke, and the 20 and 21 <hi>verſe:</hi> That for all this ſaith the Text, notwithſtanding the letting looſe of the <hi>Turkes</hi> from <hi>Euphrates, yet they repented not of the workes of their hands, that they ſhould not worſhip Devills, and Idolls of Gold, and Silver, and Braſſe, and Stone, and of Wood, &amp;c. Neither repented they of their murthers, nor of their ſorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their Thefes:</hi> So that its evident the Turkiſh Empire was raiſed up, and ſtands to this day, as a ſcourge of God upon the idolatries, and ſuperſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon their murthers, and witch-crafts, and thefts, by which the whole Chriſtian world hath been abuſed theſe many hundred yeares.</p>
            <p>So that then the Angell that powred out this <hi>Viall</hi> yee heard to be thoſe ten Chriſtian Kings, of whom ye read more at large in the next Chapter: that ſhall dry up this Fountaine: that is to ſay, the ſtreames of antichriſtian worſhip, and pollution; ſhall ſtop the courſe of it. They ſhall ſtop the courſe of thoſe Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous inquiſitiones; They ſhall ſtop the courſe of thoſe Thefts; and indulgences and pennances: they ſhall ſtop the courſe of of thoſe Whoredomes, wherewith <hi>Babylon</hi> hath beene made drunke; the cup of her Fornication. Now when this ſtreame of corruption is dryed up by the reformation of proteſtant Kings; it ſhall come to paſſe, that there will be a way made for the Kings of the Eaſt to come in: for yee heard, that by the Kings of the Eaſt are properly meant the <hi>Iewes:</hi> as being of old called Kings, A royall Prieſthood: ſo that way is made for them by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of religion in Chriſtendome; The removing of thoſe abuſes (to wit) of the corruption of religion, and popiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and idolatry, way is made for their converſion: and doe but dry up thoſe ſtreames, and then you leave <hi>Babylon</hi> dry; and you leave the Turkiſh Monarchy weakened: for the ſtaffe of the Turkiſh Monarchy is the ſuperſtition of Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme.</p>
            <p>From hence therefore yee have heard already theſe two notes gathered, and handled: the firſt is this, that the dayes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, wherein Chriſtian Princes ſhall dry up the ſtreames of antichriſtian corruption in Religion; And thereby alſo dry up the Fountaines of the ſtreames of the Turkiſh tyranny.</p>
            <p>Secondly, yee have heard this note (alſo) gathered, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. That upon the drying up of the ſtreames of corruption
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:156636:83"/> of Antichriſtian religion, and of Turkiſh Tyranny, way is made for the converſion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the antient people of God.</p>
            <p>Of theſe two wee ſpake the laſt day; and thus much was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be repeated, that yee might underſtand where wee are. To proceede to the next note then, the third that concernes this <hi>Viall,</hi> but the firſt at this time: Let me firſt gather the note and then ſhew you how it riſes out of the Text: then give ſome grounds of it, and make uſe of it as the Lord ſhall helpe, the note is this.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This is the ſumme. See all theſe points expreſly, and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered, and fully, in theſe two Verſes, the 13 and 14. For further then ſo I ſhall not goe at this time. And this one note opens both theſe Verſes, and all the paſſages therein.</p>
            <p>Firſt yee ſee upon the powring out of this <hi>Viall</hi> upon the river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the drying up the ſtreames thereof, that is upon the drying up of the corruptions of religion, ſuperſtition, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Murthers, and Whordomes: reſtraining and drying up all ſuch Fountaines, what followes? <hi>He ſaith the Beaſt, the Dragon, and the falſe Prophet, ſent out of their mouthes three unclean ſpirits, like Frogs; which goe forth unto the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battell of that great day of God Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To open this doctrine, and the words a little.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt for the Dragon</hi> yee have heard it noted before (from the 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi>) him to be the old Serpent, <hi>Satan:</hi> but taken chiefly as he doth act, and govern, and dwell in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtate: <hi>And therefore he is deſcribed to have ſeaven hads, and ten Hornes, in the third verſe of the</hi> 12 <hi>Chapter.</hi> But take him as he is Satan ſpiritually, and he hath neither heads, nor hornes. Take him as he governes <hi>Rome</hi> and ſo he hath ſeven heads, and ten hones. The ſeven heads are ſeven hilles: And the ten hornes are ten govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who then is the Beaſt? the Beaſt (as ye have heard) he is deſcribed by the very ſame Characters, ſeven heads and ten
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:156636:84"/> hornes, 13. <hi>Rev</hi> 9. <hi>verſe.</hi> It is ſaid to be him to whom the Dragon hath given his power, and his ſeat, and great authority; it doth therefore hold forth the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtate; not <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan nor <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian (as yee have heard) It remaines therefore to be <hi>Rome</hi> antichriſtian: which is that? The <hi>Roman</hi> viſible Catholique Church: thats the firſt Beaſt, which claimes all the power by pretence of religion, which old <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Roman Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy claimed by force of armes. <hi>Who is then the falſe Prophet?</hi> The falſe Prophet hee is never mentioned before in this booke, not by name; and yet hee is ſpoken of here <hi>as well knowne: It appeares therefore,</hi> this falſe Prophet is the 2 Beaſt in 13 <hi>Rev.</hi> 11 <hi>verſe</hi> to the end: <hi>The ſecond Beaſt there is ſaid to worke Miracles: in the</hi> 13 <hi>Verſe he doth great wonders, &amp;c. And</hi> 18 <hi>Verſe he decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them that dwell on the Earth, by the meanes of theſe miracles, &amp;c. And the ſame yee ſhall reade of the falſe Prophet in the</hi> 19 <hi>Rev.</hi> 20 <hi>Verſe, The Beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe Prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the marke of the Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And them which worſhiped his Image, &amp;c.</hi> The deſcription is the ſame of the falſe Prophet, and of the Beaſt: both of them holding forth the head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: The falſe Prophet <hi>Balaam,</hi> the Biſhop, (or Antichriſt) of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that it doth imply thus much, that the Dragon, and the Devill himſelfe did ſtir up, not the Pope onely, but the whole Catholicke Church, to gather into ſome councill, or ſome other ſolemne meeting, ſome chiefe concurſe of them, who by common content ſhall (out of their mouthes) that is to ſay, by their commands, their Cannons, and Decrees, for that is out of their mouthes: out of their commands, out of their edicts, out of their injunctions, <hi>ſhall ſend forth their uncleane Spirits;</hi> Spirits they be for nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and activity, Spirits they bee for impetuouſneſſe, and ſtrength, Spirits they be alſo for cloſe and cleanly conveyance: There is no ſtoping the gates againſt Spirits, yee cannot ſo ſtop the Cinque-ports but they will in; they will enter into any Court, Princes Palaces, or great mens Houſes; theres no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of them, they have a cleanly conveyance, and ſecret and cloſe paſſage. <hi>And they are alſo Spirits of Devills.</hi> It is not the ordinary word Devill, but <hi>Daemon,</hi> the which is wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Spirits for their knowledge, and learning: They are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſpirits, and yet Devills for their deceit and miſcheife:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:156636:84"/> 
               <hi>Ye are of your Father the devill, &amp; the works of your Father ye will doe, Iohn</hi> 8 44. Liers for deceit, &amp; Murtherers for miſcheif; theſe are the ſpirits he ſends forth, which ſurely comming as they doe, out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet, they are not ſpirits properly ſo called: They are therefore Emiſſaries ſent forth by them, men of nimble wits, and parts, active for nimbleneſſe, and cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance: and full of deceit and miſchiefe. And theſe are the ſpirits are ſent forth: and here ſaid to be three ſpirits comming out of their mouthes, not as if one came out of the mouth of one, and another came out of the mouth of another; but all three of them came out of all their mouthes together at once. It is not rightly tranſlated here, that he ſaith he ſaw them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out; for the word <hi>comming out,</hi> is not in the originall: <hi>but hee ſaw them out of thoſe mouthes,</hi> out of thoſe mouthes they had came; thence they had their originall, and from thence they ſprange.</p>
            <p>Much inquiry there is who they ſhould bee: I will not trouble you with variety of mens judgements, The Dragon is no more here the Turkiſh Empire then before, but the Dragon here is hee that is before called Satan, acting <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo hath ſeven Heads, and ten Hornes; which are the Armes of <hi>Rome,</hi> as yee have heard before, not of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> And it is hee that conſults, and conſpires with the Beaſt of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſend forth theſe three uncleane Spirits. Now if you ſhall put all together that hath beene obſerved by different Interpreters, and conſider withall what kinde of ſpirits the Catholique Church, and the head thereof (the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) hath troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church withall, yee ſhall finde they all fall under three ſorts: three ſorts of ſpirits they doe all iſſue from; and theſe have all inſpired and breathed into them the very Character of the nature which is found in the Dragon, the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet. There are many rables of popiſh orders, which were endleſſe to name now: But they are all ſummed up in three Heads: for all the other are but hangbies, and traines to them: all the Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſpirits whereby ſhee hath troubled the Church, they all fall under theſe three, either Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, Biſhops, or Jeſuites: and under the Jeſuites I ranke all regular Fryers, they are all of them of one nature, regular
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:156636:85"/> men, Cloyſter-men; of which the Jeſuites are the cheife; and I would rather inſtance the Jeſuites, becauſe the reſt of that rabble (the other orders of Fryers and Monkes) they are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed not under the name of Frogs, but under the name of Locuſts, chirping Creatures, as the Frogs are Croking: and both come out of the bottomleſſe pit: But the other are more like to Locuſts, in the 9 <hi>Revelations</hi> 3 to 11. They be both of them miſcheivous, both the Locuſts, and the Frogs too; but the Frogs are a little too dull for this kind of imployment, which is attributed to the Frogs: but theſe three the Dragon, the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, ſend forth the Cardinalls, the Biſhops, and the Jeſuites: yee ſhall finde the quinteſſence of nimble wits in theſe Spirits; active and nimble ſpirits, yee ſhall finde them cloſe and ſecret in their conveyances, like ſpirits: no part can be ſo ſecretly watcht but they will enter in, no Gates of Princes Pallaces ſo ſecret but thy will enter them. And uncleane they be as neither fit for meat nor for ſacrifice: as uncleane Beaſts were. They are neither fit for Church nor Common-wealth: neither fit for the one nor the other, neither for meate nor ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: uncleane alſo ariſing out of the mud; uncleane in their Doctrine, rooting out the Doctrine of Life; uncleane in their converſation, as all falſe Teachers more or leſſe bee, <hi>Iude</hi> 8. and 10 <hi>Verſe.</hi> And making the Countries uncleane where they come: they let looſe the raines and open a doore unto all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe and Prophaneſſe. <hi>Three unclean Spirits like Frogs.</hi> This deſcription of them likening of them to Frogs doth exclude them from the Locuſts, for they are not Amphibia (as they call them) ſuch as can live upon the Waters or Earth: for Locuſts love not to be in the Waters; but theſe are indifferent on Earth or Waters: Therefore theſe three can indifferently live either upon the waters, or upon the Earth; and even as well in the one as in the other. It is indifferent to them whether yee imploy them in Church worke, they can domineer there; or whether you imploy them in ſtate matters, they are as free, and as buſy there, in the Courts of Princes, and the ſtates of Commonwealths, and as impetuous there, and as active there, and as cunning, and as dominering, and Lordly there as they are in the Church.</p>
            <p>And therefore looke as were the plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> (which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:156636:85"/> is called <hi>Sodom</hi>) ſo are theſe plagues of ſpirituall <hi>Sodom.</hi> The Frogs they came upon them cunningly, and would come into the Kings Pallaces, and no place could be kept free from them: Even ſuch are theſe three uncleane ſpirits, no place can they be kept out from. And like unto Frogs are they for their continuall croking; nothing but one kinde of tune: their own matters they never leave croking of not like theſe Frogs here in <hi>America</hi> that have a ſeverall tune in each part of the yeare, but they are alwayes in one, or two, or three at the moſt; either the Catholique viſible Church, or the Pope the Judge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, or of viſible ſucceſſion. And then looke as yee ſee it is with Frogs they are moſt buſy with their notes when it growes darke, and in the heat of the day they are a great deall more ſilent, for then they get them downe into the mud; ſo it is with theſe uncleane ſpirits, they ly cloſe if the light of the Goſpell ſhines forth brightly; And if it grow warme in the zeall of the ſpirits of Chriſtians, then yee here no newes of them, but they are in ſome muddy places then, they are huſht then: I if you ſhould come with a Torch in the midnight they are ſilent and ſtill then.</p>
            <p>But now when there is want of light, or want of heat of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then it is indeed that theſe ſpirits are moſt croking, and tumultuous, and unquiet: but otherwiſe if the ſpirits of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and States-men grow warme in Religion, ther's no noiſe nor newes of theſe ſpirits; ſo theſe are the three uncleane ſpirits that come out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet. And theſe three have left a ſpice of their own nature in them, the Devill hath left a ſpice of his murther and malice againſt religion, and well ordered government tending to diſorder; the Catholique Church hath left them hir ſtate and preheminence, hir Lordly Dominion and ſpirituall ſupremacy, and authority, carying all before him; The falſe Prophet hath left them corrupt Doctrine and corrupt worſhip; Theſe corrupt all where they come, and with cleanly conveyance in the Name of the Lord, and thus ſaith the Lord: when indeed it is nothing but the meere inventions of the ſinfull falſe hearts of the ſonnes of men. To goe on a little further in the expoſition of theſe ſpirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are the ſpirits of Devills,</hi> That is to ſay all of a devilliſh
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:156636:86"/> nature; they are not Gods ſpirits: men they will be accounted to be, but they are ſpirits of the bottomleſſe pit, the ſpirits of Devills, Devills for learning, and Devills for deceit, and Devills for miſcheife.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Working miracles,]</hi> It is a proper worke of the ſecond Beaſt, but they are all but lying wonders, they come (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>with all power of ſignes and lying wonders.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. And theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thus furniſht, the Text tells you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They goe forth unto the Kings of the Earth]</hi> by Earth in this booke is meant the Earthly Religion, and ſo to the Princes of Earthly religion they goe forth, therefore they goe unto the Kings of the Earth, <hi>And of the whole World]</hi> They doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelves in the limits of Chriſtendome, but the other Princes, the Princes of the whole world (that is to ſay) to <hi>Pagan</hi> Princes, They would have power to prevent (if it were poſſible) this great miſchiefe to themſelves, that they might cruſh theſe Chriſtian Kings that brought in the reformation; Therefore they goe forth to the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole World, <hi>To gather them to battell, To the battell of that great day of God Almighty.]</hi> That's not the laſt judgement, (as ſome have thought) there will be no warring then; but every day of great execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is called a great day of God Almighty. But that we ſhall ſpeake to (God willing) when we come to it, of that great day of God Almighty.] But what day is that? yee have it expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the 19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>It is the day of Gods great Supper; that yee may eat the fleſh of Kings, and the fleſh of Captaines, and the fleſh of mighty men, &amp;c.</hi> This is the great day of God Almighty, on which theſe worldly and wicked, theſe Popiſh and Pagan Princes with all their power, and all their forces, and armies they are able to make, ſhall come forth againſt the Lord Jeſus, and againſt theſe Chriſtian Princes, that have beene ſerious, and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the reformation of Religion, and in the drying up of theſe ſtreames of corruption. Thus you ſee the words opened, and the plaine and true meaning of them. I cannot ſpeake of the comming of Chriſt now, and of the gathering together to the great battell of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> and I would not open more then I am able to finiſh at this preſent. Therefore now conſider the Doctrine againe, and the truth of it, how it doth plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the words of the Text.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:156636:86"/>
            <p>Upon the powring out of the ſixth <hi>Viall</hi> (that is to ſay) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the drying up of the current, and ſtreames of the corruption of Antichriſtian religion, or Chriſtian religion (for Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion is but the corruption of religion in Chriſtendome,) The Dragon (that is to ſay the Devill) and the Beaſt (that is to ſay the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique viſible Church,) and the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (that is to ſay the Pope the head of the Church) did ſend forth out of their mouthes (that is to ſay out of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) three uncleane ſpirits, (that is Cardinalls, and Biſhops, and Jeſuites.)</p>
            <p>To ſtir up the Princes of the Earth, and of the whole World, (that is both Popiſh, and Pagan Princes) to a great battell. To what end? ye may ſee by the occaſion of it, is was upon the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out the <hi>Viall</hi> of the wrath of God upon the ſtreames of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of religion, therefore they would turne the ſtreame againe, to prevent the way of the Kings of the Eaſt (that is) the converſion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by bringing in old Idolatry and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, ſpirituall Adulteries and Whoredomes, and Witchcrafts, for the maintenance of the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the point plaine from the Text, neither is there any difficulty that remaines for the opening of it, that I doe diſcerne.</p>
            <p>Now then for the Reaſons of the point, and ſo briefly to come to the uſe. The reaſons are two, why that upon this drying up of the ſtreames of corruption of Religion theſe three great commanders ſhould thus ſend forth ſuch kinde of Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, inſtruments that will bee active, and nimble to gather ſuch a fearfull Battell againſt the Lord, and againſt his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>The firſt reaſon is taken from the nature of their Kingdome. <label type="milestone">

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou have heretofore heard that theſe words ſet forth a deſcription of the pouring out of the ſixth Vial. Set forth it is by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, upon the great River <hi>Euphrates.</hi> By the effects, they were double: Firſt, Immediate, the waters thereof were dryed up. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was Accidentall, and mediate, warlike preparation. The former effect of drying up the River, was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by the end; That <hi>the way of the Kings of the Eaſt might be prepared.</hi> The accidentall effect, (which was warlike prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) was ſet forth by a double argument: Firſt, by the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, Principal and Inſtrumentall. Secondly, by the watch-word which the Lord gives his people. The efficients were (princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally) the Devill, the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet. The Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals were certaine ſpirits, for nature: three ſpirits for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Unclean for quality: Like Frogs for ſimilitude: Out of the mouth of the Beaſt, the Dragon, and the falſe Prophet: For their originall which are deſcribed by their effects, which are three: They work miracles; <hi>They goe forth to the Kings of the earth, to gather them to battell:</hi> And thirdly, <hi>They doe gather them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The watch-word which is the ſecond Adjunct, obſerved in this warlike preparation, is the watch-word of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to his people (in the words of my Text) there are two parts

It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovefull for the people of God, to behold the Lord Jeſus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againſt them, or <hi>comming to them as a theefe.</hi> That's the note: when the Lord expoſes his people to great trials, by the buſie diligence of thoſe Frogs, or by the violent rage of the Beaſt and Kings of the earth, againſt Religion: The Lord then cals his people to behold him comming upon them, (I meane upon all the profeſſors of the Goſpell) the Lord cals them to looke upon him comming at them, or <hi>comming to them as a theefe. Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I come as a theefe.</hi> When doth he ſay ſo? when theſe Frogs were let forth: Thoſe unclean ſpirits of Devils ſent forth to ſtirre up <hi>the Kings of the earth, and of the world to gather them to battell,</hi> againſt the Lord, and againſt his people, and againſt Chriſtian Religion, and them that maintaine it. Then, <hi>Behold, I come as a theefe:</hi> They are the words of the Lord Jeſus. Becauſe the notes are double, that the Text holds forth; I muſt be briefe in either of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As a theef]</hi> The Scripture hath reſpect to a foure-fould man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a theefe comming. He doth not come as a theefe in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or robbery: That the holy Spirit of the Lord Jeſus cannot be capable of. How can hee ſteale any thing from us, which is not his own: There is nothing but it is his, and therefore in that ſenſe he cannot be ſaid to come as a theefe, (But yet) as a theefe he can come ſuddenly, and he can come ſecretly and ſlily, yea, and he can come alſo violently, and terribly, as a theefe.</p>
            <p>Thus he can come, and thus he is deſcribed in the Scripture to come; which, though ſome think it to be at the laſt judgement,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156636:91"/> yet I cannot ſo conceive it; for here's a world of buſineſſe that is to be tranſlated after this Vial is poured out: above a thouſand yeers after this, before the coming of Chriſt to the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but his coming in any notable judgement, his coming, eſpecially if it be a coming ſuddenly, and ſecretly, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: It is coming as a thief, as ye have an inſtance of it in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.3. to the Church of <hi>Sardis, I will come on thee as a thief.</hi> How like a thief? <hi>Thou ſhalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.39. <hi>If the good man of the houſe had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have ſuffered his houſe to be broken through.</hi> But coming ſuddenly, and ſecretly, at unawares therefore it comes to paſſe, that the good man of the houſe is aſleep, and the thief breaks thorow and ſteals, when all is biſht then he comes, like a thief in the night, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Your ſelv as know perfectly, that the day of the Lord ſo cometh, as a thief in the night.</hi> So like a thief hee comes ſuddenly, and ſecretly. Thirdly, he comes as a thief, to take away, and bereave a man of ſuch goods as he carnally keeps, not to ſteal from him, but to recover his own: Though not as a lawleſſe thief ſtealeth, yet as a juſt recoverer of his fathers goods, out of the hands of thoſe that have not been faithfull in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them. <hi>John</hi> 10.10. <hi>The thief cometh not, but for to ſteal, and to kill, and to deſtroy: I am come, that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo he may come alſo to kill; but not unjuſtly, as a thief, but verily as a juſt Judge, upon thoſe that do not watch, and keep their garments: He may take their garments, and leave them naked, that men may ſee their ſhame, and juſtly too, becauſe they have not watched, but have ſuffred themſelves to be defiled.</p>
            <p>Thus then Chriſt will come at that time (yee ſhall have many men ſerious of Reformation, when the Lord ſhall dry up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that makes glad the city of <hi>Babel</hi>) when the ten Kings ſhall come to make the Whore deſolate: the Lord will then come and try all thoſe Kings and their ſouldiers, who ever they are he will try them: in the Frogs he will try them, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſlily, for they will not ceaſe to be inchanting, as ſecretly as they can, into the hearts of Kings, and all godly ſpirits; to turne things backe againe into the former courſe of corruption: into thoſe idolatries and thefts, which made glad the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which did uphold the <hi>Turke.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:156636:92"/>
            <p>And in the Kings of the earth, and of the world, he will come upon them as a thief violently and terribly, to ſhake the hearts of all the Kings of Chriſtendom (as its called) to withdraw them from the Reformation of Religion, which they ſhall be zealouſly addicted to; ſuddenly to drive them to their former ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of their fore-fathers. So in one ſort of theſe he will come as a thief, ſecretly and ſlily; In the other ſort of theſe, he will come as a thief, violently and terribly.</p>

So here he comes in theſe unclean ſpirits, for the Lord acts them; he comes in Potent Princes, for he is ſaid to come in the likeneſſe of theſe, he comes in them both; and he is ſaid to come as a thief, in the likeneſſe of theſe Frogs, becauſe they come in his likeneſſe. <hi>Ye ſhall have many falſe Prophets come in my name,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. Take heed of them, for they ſhall deceive many; they ſhall come ſecretly, and ſlily, and play legerdemain, and by that means deceive many; and they ſhall come outragiouſly, firſt againſt the Lord and his people; and the Lord comes forth in their rage: that look as it is ſaid (by ſome Interpreters) of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. <hi>He fought with beaſts at Epheſus, after the manner of men;</hi> they interpret it thus, not that ever he was put to any ſuch triall (that any probable Stories mention) in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or any where elſe; <hi>but he fought with beaſts at Epheſus, after the manner of men;</hi> becauſe, the men of <hi>Epheſus</hi> fought with him after the manner of beaſts: So Chriſt is ſaid to come in theſe men, becauſe they come in the name of Chriſt, and plead for the Catholick Church of Chriſt, and the Vicar of Chriſt. <hi>Behold, I come as a thief;</hi> they are all but theeves, though they pretend to come in the name of Chriſt; that may be one part of the meaning: But yet notwithſtanding, this that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth do I moſt of all cleave unto, not excluding that.</p>
            <p>This may be another, taken from the authority of Chriſt, and power of Chriſt, in leading a people into temptation, what ever the inſtruments be; I ſay it is the Lord Jeſus that leads his people into all kindes of temptation, whatſoever the inſtruments be: If any Prophet be deluded, it is Chriſt the Lord hath deluded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156636:92"/> that Prophet: Or if any Tyrants be ſet up, it is the Lord that ſets them up: Or what ever unclean ſpirits come againſt his Church, it is the Lord that ſtirred them up, it is the Lord that ſtirred them up unto this battell againſt his Church, it is the Lord that ſtirred them up, what ever the inſtruments be, be they Frogs, or unclean ſpirits that gathers to the battels of Pray; And therefore we are taught to pray in (that which is commonly called) the Lords Prayer (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13.). <hi>Lead us not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> We pray to the Lord, that he would not lead us into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation: As who ſhould ſay, to the Lord it belongs, to bring one creature againſt another; the devil againſt <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> againſt the devil; the Lord it is that brings the evil, whoever be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; it is the Lord that brings his challenge into the field, he brings <hi>Goliah</hi> into the valley of <hi>Elah.</hi> And therefore when it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. that <hi>Satan roſe up againſt Iſrael, and provoked David to number Iſrael.</hi> In 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 24.1. it is ſaid, <hi>The anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael, and he moved David againſt them, to ſay, Go number Iſrael and Judah.</hi> The Lord was angry with the people, and then he let Satan looſe to tempt <hi>David</hi> to number the people: It was the Lords doings, though it was Satans act. And ſo, when <hi>Micaiah</hi> in his Viſion <hi>ſaw the Lord ſitting on his Throne, and all the hoſte of Heaven ſtanding by him, on his right hand, and on his left. And the Lord ſaid, Who ſhall perſwade Ahab, that he may go up, and fall at Ramoth-Gilead? And one ſaid on this manner, and another ſaid on that manner.</hi> At length (ſaith the Text) <hi>there came forth a ſpirit, and ſtood before the Lord, and ſaid, I will perſwade him. And the Lord ſaid unto him, Wherewith? And he ſaid, I will go forth, and I will be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. And he ſaid, Thou ſhalt perſwade him, and prevail alſo:</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>Go forth and do ſo.</hi> 1 Kings 22.19, 20, 21, 22. So that (minde you) whoever goes forth, the Lord ſends him, the Dragon, the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, may give one Commiſſion, but the Lord gives him permiſſion; yea, and (I may ſay) Commiſſion too: For in effecting the thing, the Lord doth it; that as <hi>David</hi> ſaith of <hi>Shimei, The Lord hath bid him curſe me:</hi> (that is to ſay) he hath given him effectuall liberty, and opportunity to do the thing, as if he had given him a command to do it.

            <p>For <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray Chriſt to the Jewes Eccleſiaſtical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and for the Jewes to deliver Chriſt into the hands of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> it was a great ſin, and ſo much the greater, becauſe <hi>Pilates</hi> authority was of God; and they would arme the ſword of God againſt the Lord Jeſus: And if <hi>Pilate</hi> had the power given him of God either to crucifie Chriſt, or looſe him: if he ſhall abuſe his authority, in putting Chriſt to death, as he did: <hi>Then he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater ſinnes:</hi> But thou then that doſt abuſe thy power, to crucifie me, ſhalt bee found very ſinfull in the end: So that, that will not excuſe any Inſtrument for abuſing the power for ſuch an end.

            <p>If we ask how this can be imagined? <hi>Anſ.</hi> All this acting with theeeves is an accidentall concurring; in all theſe things

            </p>
            <p>I was worth thus much within this twelve month, and now not worth halfe ſo much; <hi>Bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> I was rich in cattell, or in this or that commodity, but now the priſes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156636:94"/> are fallen, they are not worth half, nor (it may be) one third of that they were; the Lord hath done this, he hath come upon us on a ſudden like a thief, and bleſſed be his name for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it helps us in the uſe and improvement of them all, it naturally leads men by the hand, to humble themſelves under the hand of God: and this is the onely way to obtain delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.6. <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</hi> Its not the caſualties or calamities of the Country that comes either by chance, or fortune, but from the Lord, he taketh away all, by one means or another, takes away all; whether by our pride, that we muſt have every new faſhion, and be like the men of the world, in houſes, apparell, and the like, or daintineſſe, that we muſt have our varieties, be it what it will be, though it coſt never ſo much; and no matter what follows, though it eat up our eſtates, and brings us into want: The Lord hath made uſe of our folly, and pride, and daintineſſe, our idleneſſe, our covetouſneſſe, (or what ever it be) to bring us into poverty, the Lord hath done it; and let the people of God ſee the hand of God in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it leads you by the hand in all the ſad changes that paſſe over you, to look to the Lord, and to wreſtle with the Lord, and not to ſtand wreſtling with men: <hi>Jacob</hi> he is in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and he wreſtles with the Lord, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 32.26. And ſo it behoves the Lords people to wreſtle with the Lord, and not to ſtand conteſting with the Biſhops, nor with the Jeſuits, as it may be men may do: No, no, prevail with the Lord, and get him to turn all things about; and if <hi>Jacob</hi> get God to bleſſe him, <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhall not (then) curſe him. I will not let thee go till thou bleſſe me; and if the Lord bleſſe <hi>Jacob, Eſau</hi> ſhall be curs'd.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, it will help you to quit your ſelves like men in all the things that do befall you; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 16.13. <hi>God hath ſet us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>upon a Theatre,</hi> (as the word is in the originall, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 4.9.) <hi>unto the world, and unto Angels, and unto men;</hi> therefore ſaith he, <hi>quit your ſelves like men,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35.) <hi>Caſt not away your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward; for ye have need of patience,</hi> &amp;c.

There is a righteouſneſſe therefore of a mans own, to wit, ſpirituall graces; as, <hi>Zachary and Elizabeth were both righteous before God,</hi> Luke 1.6. And it is well obſerved by ſome holy Divines, that he puts a double Epithite upon this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Saints, a double commendation; they are pure, and they are bright, this fine linnen its both pure and bright; for the words are in the originall <gap reason="foreign">

So then thoſe are the garments, cloathed in bright and in pure garments: And theſe garments are the righteouſneſſes of the Saints. Garments, why?

And the Lord ſaid, Who is that faithfull and wiſe Steward, whom his Lord ſhall make ruler over his houſhold, to give them their meat in due ſeaſon? Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall finde ſo doing:</hi> in the 22 and 43 verſes of the ſame Chapter. When a man watches to the improving of his calling, unto thoſe good ends, for which God hath given him it. Why? <hi>Bleſsed is that man, which when the Lord cometh, he ſhall finde ſo doing.</hi> And fourthly, he watches unto his own heart, that he does not truſt to his own righteouſneſſe; and runs away from God by deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and unbelief of his own heart: <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>leſt there be in any of you an heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God,</hi> Heb. 3.12.

So ſee now by this means, whileſt a man watcheth unto prayer, watcheth to the Word, watcheth to his calling, and watcheth over his own unclean, corrupt, and deceitfull heart; Hence it comes to paſſe, that he keeps his garments ſo bright; in one word, he keeps faith and a good conſcience, and faith helps him to keep his garments: He keeps holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and all is kept in this holy way. So that by this means, what ever theeves or robbers come, a mans garments are kept clean; he is not gulled out with thoſe Frogs, nor frighted or tyred out with theſe Kings of the earth. So that by this means he doth not ſhew his own nakedneſſe, but doth injoy his own bleſſedneſſe.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> For the Reaſon of this Point briefly, and ſo come to the Uſe. The Reaſon is taken from the Lords graciouſneſſe, and tender reſpect to a watchfull ſpirit.</p>
            <p>It is (as I remember) one of the aboundanteſt promiſes of grace that is made to any eſtate of Gods people, that he makes to a watchfull heart, in the fore-named place in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.37. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are thoſe ſervants whom the Lord when he commeth ſhall finde watching:</hi> why, wherein lyes their bleſſedneſſe? <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>ſhal gird up himſelfe, and make them to ſit down to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them.</hi> A wel-girt Chriſtian hath ever a well-girt Chriſt to miniſter to him; that as his garments

            <p>And a ſecond Reaſon is taken from the wofull nakedneſſe of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> corrupt nature, eſpecially in a Chriſtian profeſſion: A wel-girt Chriſtian will bluſh and be aſhamed for any miſ-carriage before God and men. <hi>O my God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ezra</hi>) <hi>I am aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee my God, for our iniquities are encreaſed over our head,</hi> &amp;c. Ungirtneſſe, or looſeneſſe, fils a Chriſtian with ſhame. I ſay, if this be the ſhamefulneſſe of ſinne, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of it, that a man is not ſo aſhamed of the nakedneſſe of his body, as a Chriſtian of the ungirtneſſe of his ſpirit; why then (mind yee) he that watches and keeps his garments, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes his own bleſſedneſſe, and prevents the ſhamefull diſcovery of his own nakedneſſe. The uſe of this point is thus much.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it may teach us, how to eſteeme truly and rightly of the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> nature both of ſin and righteouſneſſe, how to take a true eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both. Look at your paſſions, and look at your luſts, and look at all your naturall parts: what are they all? (if they be not over-powred with holy gifts of grace) they are the very naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſhame of a man. If a man will have his own will, and not Gods will, the ſhame of ſtubbornneſſe lyes upon that mans heart. A ſpirit that is not lively and wakefull, but heavie and drowſie, it is a ſhamefull nakedneſſe. Covetouſneſſe is the very ſhame of a man; Pride is the very ſhame of a man. A man thinks himſelfe the goodlieſt of all, and is ſhamefull in the eyes of all. Wantonneſſe is the very ſhame of a man. A man thereby makes himſelfe one of the fooles in Iſrael. So all errours in a man, they are the ſhame of a man; and ſo all the ſinfull miſcarriages of a man, they are the ſhame and nakedneſſe of a man, that he may bluſh to behold, and to think, and to heare of. And it will be a greater ſhame not to behold them, not to be willing to ſee them, when he is juſtly taxed with them. You think you will have your own will, and will ſhift off well enough all that is laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, verily it is the ſhame of your nakedneſſe. All paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and proud carriages expreſſed in word or deed, are the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:156636:97"/> ſhame of a mans nakedneſſe. And idleneſſe in a mans calling, is the very nakedneſſe and ſhame of a man So on the other ſide, what is righteouſneſſe? the white linnen of a Chriſtian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>? pure ſhining garments? They are ſuch, that if the Lord looke upon a man, he is pure in his eyes; if the world looke upon him, he is bright, yea, it even dazels the eyes of wicked men. I ſay, it is the honour of a Chriſtiam, it is the comlineſſe of his perſon. There is no garment, that becomes a Chriſtian ſo well, as to be clothed from top to toe with the pure g rments of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe imputed. Inherent righteouſneſſe is not ſo comely, ſave in the eyes of men. A tender conſcience, a ſpirit eaſie to be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is a comely ſpirit; a man void of paſſion, that hath the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and reines of his affections, it is a great beauty to a man; both righteouſneſſe inherent, and righteouſneſſe imputed, they make us walke ſo, as no man ſhall ſee our nakedneſſe and ſhame. Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in a mans calling, and truſtineſſe and faithfulneſſe are comely things in Chriſtians. A well-girt Chriſtian the Lord wil keepe, that men ſhall not ſee his nakedneſſe; though in many things he may faile and be aſhamed, yet the Lord keepes him that men ſee not his nakedneſſe.

I ſay in ſuch a caſe as this is; if the Lord give up the ſpirits of men (as I doubt not but he doth) thoſe that are ſo, take it for your comfort; yee that are cloſe girt, cary it home as an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto continuall watchfulneſſe.

The Lord will hide them under the ſhadow of his wings, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from ſhamefull fals; or will hide the ſhamefulneſſe of them; and the Lord will for the preſent be girt cloſe to you: He will be ever and anon helping you in all trials and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when you have moſt need of him, then ſhall ye finde him ready to be moſt near you.

The Battell of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> which is in the valley of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> is ſpoken of in the 20. <hi>chapter</hi> of this booke; therefore you read that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill was bound a thouſand yeares, and then looſed out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and at length caſt into the Lake that burneth with fire, and brimſtone; (<hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10.) where he found the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the falſe <hi>Prophet,</hi> who were both caſt in before, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20.

            <p>There was a ſecond battell fought at <hi>Megiddon,</hi> and that by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Ioſiah</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh Nechoh</hi> who met <hi>Ioſiah</hi> at <hi>Megiddo,</hi> and ſlew him there, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 23.29. whereupon there grew a great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, in ſo much, that all <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> mourned for <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> lamented for <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and all the ſinging men and ſinging women ſpake of <hi>Ioſiah</hi> in their Lamentations, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.24, 25. And hereupon <hi>Ieremiah</hi> wrote the booke of <hi>Lamentations,</hi> as if he had ſeene the City ruined, their wives raviſhed, their children toſſed upon the ſpeares of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, becauſe the breath of Church and Common-Wealth, and every Family was choaked in the death of <hi>Ioſiah.</hi> And the like Effect of mourning ſhall this battell fought in <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon</hi>

Therefore it is ſpoken of in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, becauſe this ſhall befall the <hi>Hebrew</hi> people, as when you read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.11. that the King of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit hath his name in the <hi>Hebrew Abaddon,</hi> and in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue <hi>Apolion,</hi> it is to be underſtood that hee is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer both unto the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and if you ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward heare of ſome tnat ſing <hi>Halelujah,</hi> know of a truth that it principally concerneth thoſe, in whoſe language it is ſpoken, (for every Nation is to praiſe <hi>God</hi> in his owne Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:) ſo the battell will be fought in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> becauſe as it will be a great deſtruction to <hi>Gods</hi> Enemies, ſo it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a peninentiall, and comfortable mourning at the length unto the <hi>Iewes.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But why is it called the Hill of <hi>MEGIDDON,</hi> theſe battels were fought in the valley? therefore the Holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> would not expreſſe it barely by the name of <hi>Magiddo,</hi> that ſo he might point beſides theſe, at another battell which was fought in the hill of <hi>Megiddon:</hi> now the hill that looked over this valley, was <hi>Mount Gilboa,</hi> where the battell was fought by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> upon whoſe overthrow <hi>David</hi> was eſtabliſhed in the Kingdome; The men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and his ſonnes fell downe ſlaine in <hi>Mount Gilboa,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.28. From hence went <hi>Saul</hi> to enquire of the Witch at <hi>Endor,</hi> and that was in the valley of <hi>Megiddon;</hi> ſo they were nigh one to another, for <hi>Baraks</hi> battell with <hi>Sifera</hi> was fought neere <hi>Endor, Pſal.</hi> 83.9, 10. Thus wee have an alluſion to all theſe three notable and memorable battels, whereas had he ſaid in a place in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue <hi>Gilboa,</hi> then had hee limited the alluſion unto <hi>Sauls</hi> battell, who was indeed a deſtroyer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but ſo other effects of this battell fought in this Text, had not beene pointed at. Therefore that hee might graſpe in all thoſe Events, which thoſe battels that were fought about <hi>Megiddon</hi> brought forth, he ſaith the place was called <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon;</hi> and it is an uſuall thing that battels in the hill are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<pb facs="tcp:156636:100"/> to the valley, and in the valley to the <hi>Hill:</hi> the hill and the valley lying neere together. And indeed the ſame Events will this battell bring forth, which fell out upon all the former battels at <hi>Megiddo.</hi> So then the ſumme is, that theſe ſpirits went forth to gather theſe Popiſh and Heathen <hi>Princes</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, into a place called in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue <hi>Armaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where the battell ſhall have the like ſucceſſe, that it had of old unto the deſtruction of <hi>Gods</hi> Enemies, the utter ruine of Antichriſt, as of <hi>Saul,</hi> the ſetling of the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon <hi>David,</hi> unto the converſion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who ſhall upon this occaſion mourne bitterly over him, whom they have pierced. Onely let us a little further cleare one ſcruple which may ſomewhat remaine; why ſhall the <hi>Iewes</hi> come in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this victory? ſhall they mourne with Indignation for the ſucceſſe of Chriſtian <hi>Princes,</hi> and States? or ſhall it bee a mourning of compaſſion for the deſtruction of <hi>Rome?</hi> no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, the text is plaine, they will rejoyce for both, and joyne together with the reſt of the Chriſtian Churches to praiſe the name of the Lord with <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> in the 19. <hi>chapter</hi> of this booke and the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> After theſe things, (that is after the deſtruction of <hi>Babel) I heard a great voyce of much people in Heaven ſaying Hallelujah:</hi> So againe <hi>ver.</hi> 3.6. they ſhall praiſe God with an <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> as well as the Latines with a <hi>Laudate Dominum:</hi> It is therefore neither a mourning of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation for the ſucc ſſe of the Saints, nor of compaſſion for the Rivers of <hi>Babell;</hi> but (what is it then?) It is a mourning of compunction whereby they, (ſeeing in this <hi>battell</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is indeed the true <hi>Meſſias)</hi> they ſhall mourne that they have beene ſo long eſtranged from him; for two maine ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks will this <hi>battell</hi> remove out of their way.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that which is their great ſtumbling block, to wit, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Pope who is counted the Father of Chriſtian Churches, and yet himſelfe liveth like an <hi>Epicure,</hi> and maintaineth Idolatry and ſuperſtition; and though many in the world abhorre his wayes, yet they looke at them but as Sects, and inferiour people and States, in reſpect of the Pope and Popiſh Princes; but when they ſhall ſee that the Zeale of Chriſtian Princes hath dryed up thoſe ſtreames of Superſtition, to the utter confuſion of the man of ſinne, then will they alſo ſee that, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> whom they have reſiſted all this while, even that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>

And moreover I doe beleeve, that great will bee the power of the Miniſtery of the word in fighting of this <hi>battell,</hi> by declaring the powerfull preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with them, and for them; thus ſhall the ſword of the Miniſtery of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> prevaile migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, by animating Chriſtian Princes and people, according as it is ſaid, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.21. of this booke; the remnant were ſlaine with the ſword that proceedeth out of his mouth, that is, out of the mouth of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and when the word of <hi>Chriſt</hi> goeth along with the ſword of Princes, you need not wonder if it doe not onely prevaile againſt the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and falſe Prophet, but alſo to make <hi>Satan</hi> fall downe from Heaven like lightning, even out of the hearts of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> from deceiving them any longer.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the opening of the words, which though it have beene long and difficult, yet many times things moſt difficult to open, are ſweeteſt to chew upon, as in all bones, and the like; let us therefore from hence obſerve this note.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> See a broad difference in the cauſe and object of this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: when a man mourneth for <hi>Chriſt</hi> as wronged by him; and yet ſeeth himſelf ſaved by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> as this object is tranſcendant, ſo is the mourning tranſcendant alſo, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 26. <hi>The Spirit maketh Interceſſions for us with grones that cannot be uttered.</hi> Thus being ſet upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and fomented by his Spirit, it is eternall in the cauſes of it, and will lift up the ſoule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all undermoone diſcouragements, that a man will looke upon them as things, which <hi>God</hi> hath given and taken, and his griefe concerning them will van ſh away; but this being ſetled upon eternall obj cts can end no ſooner then life it ſelfe: And if our life in this world were eternall, ſo would this mourning be, although indeed when this life ſhall have an end, it will be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in a perfect fruition of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt place, I would commend this unto all the children of <hi>God,</hi> that they Regulate their mourning according to this mourning: Let us mourne for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for his death, and bee truly ſenſible of the great Injuries which wee have done unto him, that ſo our griefe may ſwallow up all the baſeneſſe of our hearts, and all worldly ſorrowes which cauſe death, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. But godly ſorrow worketh Repentance never to be repented of: Let us therefore in all our private and publick Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mourne after him, and mourne for him, that thereby wee may be kept from ſuch entanglements, and diſcouragements as might interrupt us in our Chriſtian Courſe upon other meaner occaſions.</p>

                  <p>And the ſeventh Angel poured out his Vial into the Ayre, and there came a great voyce out of the Temple of heaven from the Throne, ſaying, It is done.</p>
                  <p>And there were voyces, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the earth, ſo mightie an earthquake, and ſo great.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words deſcribe unto us the pouring out of the ſeventh Vial, by the ſeventh Angel; and ſet forth it is by a threefold Argument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt by the ſubject upon which it fell, it fell upon the Ayre It is tranſlated [into the Ayre] but the ſame word in the third and fourth Verſes is tranſlated upon (the Sea) and upon (the Rivers and fountaines of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156636:107"/> water:) ſo it fell upon the Ayre, otherwiſe to ſay, into the Ayre, might ſeeme to looke at ſome further ſubject, whereupon it fell, but that is not the meaning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by an adjunct accompanying the ſame, to wit [<hi>A great voyce out of the Temple of heaven,</hi> &amp;c.] for I cannot call it an effect, but an adjunct it was.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the effects, and they are threefold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of Terrour and Horrour. <hi>[There were voyces, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, and lightnings]</hi> all which doe ſtrike Terrour and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>Second effect was changes, and alterations of ſtates <hi>[And there was a great earthquake]</hi> amplified by an argument taken from the leſſe <hi>[Such as was not ſince men were upon the earth]</hi> ſo great for amplitude, ſo mighty for power.</p>
            <p>Third effect was, the working of diſtracting, and deſtroying ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities upon three ſeverall ſorts of ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Firſt upon Cities, and among them,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the great City was divided into three parts, which (with leave of Interpreters that take it to be a diſtinct City from <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>) I take to be meant of <hi>Babilon,</hi> which now came up into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance before God, and that is rendred as a reaſon how ſhee came to be deſtroyed, for ſhe came up into remembrance before God, to give her the wine, firſt of diſtraction, ſecondly of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the cities of the Nations fell, the great Citie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, it fell to ruine.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of ſubjects upon which this diſtraction fell, were <hi>[Every Iſland, and every mountaine]</hi> the Iſlands fled away, the mountaines were not found.</p>
            <p>The third ſort, was the ſonnes of men, and the plague that fell upon them was a great haile out of heaven, which is amplified.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the meaſure or weight of it <hi>[every ſtone about the weight of a Talent]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By the effect it wrought in men, <hi>[They blaſphemed the God of heaven]</hi> ſet forth by the cauſe of their blaſpheming againe repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe of the plague of the haile, for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us firſt open the words, and then ſumme them up into ſome doctrinall obſervations.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:156636:107"/>
            <p n="1">1. What (in the firſt place) is here meant by <hi>[Ayre]</hi> doubtleſſe not the element of ayre that wee breath in: for all the Vials are Vials of wrath, &amp; therefore poured upon ſubjects of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Now God is not offended with the ayre, which is his creature, but as you reade in the firſt verſe of the Chapter. All theſe Angels received a commandement to poure out their Vials upon the earth, and that is meant of the earthly Antichriſtian Church, and they all fulfill this Commandement upon whatſoever they poure out their Vials; it is ſtill upon the Antichriſtian ſtate: nor are the meſſengers of Gods wrath (which come out of the Temple, and have their loynes girded with golden girdles) provoked againſt the Ayre which themſelves doe breath in; nor could a plague be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ayre, but it would fall upon Chriſtian Churches as well as Popiſh. Others doe interpret it (with much more probabilitie) to be upon the kingdome of Sathan, for he is called the Prince that ruleth in the ayre, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. he alſo rayſeth up ſtormes in the ayre, and fiery meteors therein, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.16. So they conclude that whereſoever the Devill hath to doe, whether it be in Popery or Paganiſme, this Viall is poured upon all his kingdome. I thinke the doctrine is truly gathered from this place, that the holy Ghoſt intendeth to poure out a judgement upon all his kingdome: yet I cannot ſay that the words doe ſo properly hold forth a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Element of ayre: for all the Vials are to be poured upon the earth, the Antichriſtian Church, called earth in oppoſition to the heavenly and pure Church mentioned <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.5. there being in it the whole Fabricke and Syſteme of the world: there is an earth, and that is the loweſt and baſeſt common ſort of Catholickes in that world; and there is a Sea, their corrupt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; there be Rivers, and fountaines of water, thoſe that derived their corruptions into all countries (Prieſts and Monkes, &amp;c.) there is a Sunne in this world, the great light thereof: the family of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the common wealth, and the Popes ſupremacy in the Church: there is the throne of the beaſt, the forme of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and manner of judicature: Afterwards comes in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> the ſtreame of all thoſe corruptions that make glad the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Rome:</hi> Therefore this Ayre ſeemeth to be the Ayre of that Antichriſtian Church: Looke therefore what you can conceive to be the Ayre, which this Antichriſtian Church doth breath in, and that is the ſubject whereupon this Viall is poured: And although
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156636:108"/> indeed Mahumetry, and Paganiſme come to be afflicted here by it; yet is it but an effect of pouring out this Vial upon the Ayre. Now if you looke into Chap. 9.1, 2. of this booke you ſhall finde that the Ayre of this worldly Church is the ſmoake which aroſe out of the bottomleſſe pit, and darkned the Ayre, ſo that you could not ſee the Sunne, much leſſe the Moone and Starres: and what was that ſmoake out of the bottomleſſe pit, but the darkeneſſe of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from whence ſprung all thoſe Locuſts, and that King over them, verſ. 11. the angel of the bottomleſſe pit, whoſe name in the Hebrew tongue is <hi>Abaddon,</hi> he deſtroyeth the hope of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Jewes: and in the Greek tongue hath his name <hi>Apolly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he deſtroyeth them alſo, and ſprung out of this ignorance. There is a double uſe of Ayre, and this darkeneſſe corrupted both. 1. There is an uſe of it for ſight; for through the Ayre, if is bee cleare, you ſee all the heavenly lights, and by their help, all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour bodies. 2. It is the breath of life, which maintaineth the life of men, and is the ſupportance of their vitals. And in both theſe things doth it fitly reſemble heavenly, and ſaving knowledge, by which, 1. In the firſt place, we ſee Jeſus Chriſt the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to our juſtification; by which we ſee the Moon, that is, the true ſtate of Churches according to the Goſpell; by which we ſee the Stars, the people of God, and who indeed are his people, that ſhine like lights in the world: And hereby they ſee all things here below, and judge rightly of them. And 2. by the ſame ſaving knowledge doe we breathe in our vitals (that we may ſo ſpeak) our ſpirituall life; <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> Eſay 53.11. <hi>And this is life eternall to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> John 17.3. Now if this Ayre be choaked, you can neither ſee Jeſus Chriſt to your juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, nor breath in any ordinance of his to your ſalvation, nor can you ſee what is the true Church, nor who are the true Saints of God; you can rightly diſcerne of nothing, if once the Sun, and the whole body of the ayre be darkened; but if how there come an Angel that ſhall poure out his Vial upon his ſmoke of the ayre, and diſpell thereby the clouds of darkneſſe, and ignorance; then ſhall you clearly ſee Jeſus Chriſt, and the true ſtate of his Church, and of all viſible Saints, then ſhall you draw in true and lively breath from every ordinance of God. This is therefore the ayre whereupon this Vial ſhall be poured, and that will be the diſpelling of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156636:108"/> of it: The Lord will ſend forth ſuch a bright and cleare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Chriſt, and Church, and Saints, and holy things which will prevaile ſo far, as to diſpell all the fogs and miſts of darkneſſe, not alone in the Antichriſtian State, but in all the world: ſo that all Nations ſhall be brightened with the knowledge of God: All Aſia ſhall ſee the vanity of Mahumetry, and all the Pagan Nations, the fondneſſe and blindneſſe of their Superſtitions. And the Jews ſhall then ſee, and bewaile their blindneſſe, and wretchedneſſe in ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt Jeſus Chriſt: So that moſt true it is which godly Interpreters have ſaid, that hereby all the kingdomes of Satan are threatened, though it be rather an effect of it, then the true, and proper ſence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is then the adjunct that followeth, or goeth along with it: <hi>[There came a great voice out of the Temple of heaven from the Throne]</hi> And that Throne is ſet in the Church. Rev. 4.2, 3. <hi>Behold, a Throne was ſet in heaven, and one ſate on the Throne, which is the Lord himſelfe:</hi> who is reſembled by three pretious ſtones, holding forth the three perſons in Trinity: A Jaſper having (as they ſay) a white circle round about it; repreſenting the Eternity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; a Sardine ſtone, of a fleſhy colour, repreſenting Jeſus Chriſt, who took our fleſh upon him. An Emerauld being of a green colour, refreſhing the eyes of thoſe that looke upon it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Spirit, who is (as the Rainbow) a token of faire weather, and is a comfortable refreſher whereſoever he commeth. Now this voice comming from heaven, and from the Throne, it commeth alſo apparently from God, ſaying, It is done; that ſo all men may ſee it to be the revealed, and holy will of God, that all theſe things ſhould be thus accompliſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is done</hi>] what is done? for here is no nominative caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the verb. But this is that which is done, the myſtery of iniquity is aboliſhed. And the myſtery of God is fulfilled: For of this it was ſpoken, which you read <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. where the Angel (that ſtood upon the Sea, and upon the earth) telleth us, <hi>That in the dayes of the ſeventh Angel, when he ſhall ſound</hi> (whoſe Trumpet is ſounding to this day) <hi>the myſtery of God ſhould be fulfilled;</hi> And that ſtandeth chiefly in two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the deſtruction of all his enemies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the accompliſhment of all his gracious promiſes to the converſion of the Jewes; and both theſe ſhall be accompliſhed in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156636:109"/> the pouring out of this Vial, as we may reade at large, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.17. to the end of the Chapter; where the holy Prophet ſpeaketh of this very time, when the enemies of the Church ſhall come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, there will be a finall accompliſhment of all the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of iniquity, and of all the hoſtility of the Lords enemies againſt his Church: It is alſo the accompliſhment of all his gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and therefore he ſaith <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.6. When once the new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem commeth downe from God out of heaven, then Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith, <hi>It is done.</hi> All his promiſes are now performed, and his great workes now fulfilled; this is meant, when it is here ſaid, <hi>It is done;</hi> And the Lords voice it is, for had it been the voice of ſome Church-Officers alone, it might have reached to the Church, but not to the ends of the world: but when the Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh, whoſe voice is like the voice of thunder, then is it heard from one end of the earth unto another. All men ſhall ſee the great workes that he hath done upon the face of the earth, Popery, and all falſe Religion aboliſhed; the Kingdome of Chriſt eſtabliſhed, from the riſing of the Sun to the going down thereof. This is the Adjunct.</p>
            <p>Now for the Effect: There is an Effect of Terrour, and of agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and changes, and an effect of deſtroying calamities, for I cannot well gather the notes that ariſe, unleſſe theſe things be all opened, then I conceive they may be handled with brevity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For the effect of terrour: the thunderings, and lightenings, and the voices, are the ſame with thoſe that are ſaid to come out of the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.5. Like unto that diſpenſation of old, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.18. Wherein were thunderings, and lightenings, and in ſtead of voices, there is put in, the noiſe of the Trumpet, and theſe held forth the terrour of the Lord in giving of the Law, in ſo much that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe ſaid I exceedingly feare, and quake, and much more did the people feare and tremble: for ſuch is the convincing dreadfull power of the Law of God, that let a man but heare it, and have it effectually applyed, and it will make the meekeſt and moſt innocent of the ſervants of God to tremble; It will make the mountaines and hils to tremble. The voice of Gods ſervants is like the voice of a trumpet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.1. piercing deep into the eares and hearts of men, but the voice of himſelfe exceedeth. So the meaning is, That upon the pouring out of this Vial upon the ayre, there ſhall be terrible thunderings, and lightenings, and voices like founds of Trumpets upon the hearts of men, that ſhall make them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156636:109"/> tremble and quake: The Lord will ſo terribly affright, and amaze the ſons of men with the power of his holy word, and will, as that it ſhall ſuddenly break forth all the world over; for in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth the Lord begin his ſaving diſpenſations towards men, even with terrible lightenings, and thunderings, and earthquakes, thereby partly convincing men of ſin, and ſubduing their hearts, and confounding their malicious enemies. For the next Effect.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>There was great earthquake, &amp;c.</hi>] And that importeth agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatations and changes, and not terrour onely; they are ſuch as will not ceaſe, untill they have removed the things that are ſhaken, that the things which cannot be ſhaken may remain, ſo doth the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26.27. Interprete the Propheſie of <hi>Haggai.</hi> 2.6. It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth (ſaith he) the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken; and he interprets it concerning the Church eſtate in that place; and he will alſo ſhake all the Kingdomes of the world, as the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Haggai</hi> told <hi>Zerubbabel, Chap.</hi> 2.21, 22. ſaying, I will ſhake the heavens and the earth: and I will overthrow the throne of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and I will deſtroy the ſtrength of the Kingdomes of the Heathen, &amp;c. And ſo the Lord did overthrow the great Perſian Monarchy by the Grecian, and the Grecian Monarchy by the Romane, and the Romane by barbarous Nations, and the Lord hath bin ſhaking them everſince, and will ſhake them hereafter with ſuch a ſhaking as never was the like: you reade of a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, when as Rome, of Pagan, became Chriſtian, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.12. But that was a ſmall ſhaking, unto this earthquake, for ſtill the Perſians are Idolaters, and many Pagans in the world; that ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king brought in a forme of Chriſtianity, but the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt was yet in a great, meaſure wanting; that forme of Chriſtianity which then came in, made way for Popery to creepe in faſt into the Churches, but this will ſhakeout Popery, and when by it the Popiſh aire is ſmitten, the Lord will alſo ſhake all the world by it; and the time doth haſten.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Now for the third effect, which is a diſtracting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying calamity, upon Cities, upon Iſlands, and Mountaines, and upon men: Among cities, here is the great Citie, and the cities of the Nations, and Babylon. Some good Interpreters looke at Babylon to be Conſtantinople: For my part I dare not think but one of theſe is put expoſitively for the other; Babylon for the great city: Now that great city which is ſpiritiually called Sodome, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156636:110"/> Aegypt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.8. is that great city, which reigneth over the Kings of the earth, and that is <hi>Rome,</hi> as all confeſſe; and that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.18. and this is the ſame city, which the Kings of the earth, and the Merchants of the earth doe mourne for when ſhe is deſtroyed, and ſay, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city, &amp;c.</hi> and that alſo by their confeſſion is <hi>Rome.</hi> And ſo this Latter mention of it, doth but ſhew the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it commeth to be divided into three parts, and why the cities of the Nations fell, for Babylon, came up into remembrance, &amp;c. The great city then is Babylon, and that is divided into three parts: I ſhould not thinke that it is ſpoken of the breach of the naturall walls of the city by the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake; but it will be divided into three factions; ſome will ſticke faſt unto Popery, and others of the people of God that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore durſt not openly profeſſe Religion, will now renounce Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for ſuch there ſhall be in Rome when it is neere to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unto whom it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Come out of her my people, &amp;c.</hi> and what the third part may be, there is not light, for in this place, what light other places may give, we ſhall (if God pleaſe) ſee hereafter, meane while it is ſufficient to underſtand that it will be divided into three parts: and what if the third part be a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall betweene both the other?</p>
            <p n="7">7. What were the cities of the Nations? Thoſe are they that trod the Church of God under foote, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. ſuch they were who did ſubject themſelves to Popiſh Government, the cities of thoſe Nations ſhall fall, whoſoever they be that are found ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Rome, they ſhall fall: for Babylon her ſelfe ſhall come up into remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the wine of the fierceneſſe of his wrath, which ſhall infatuate her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhe be utterly deſtroyed by thoſe ten Kings that ſhall hate her, and eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>And every Iſland fled away, and the mountaines were not found.</hi>] He ſpeaketh not of earthly Iſlands, but you muſt underſtand that he ſpeaketh of the mountaines, and Iſlands of the Antichriſtian ſtate; what are the mountaines? They are the places where they went a whoring after their Gods in old time, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.6. She is gone upon every hight mountaine, and under every greene tree, and there hath played the harlot, there they had built them Chappells, and there they had placed their confidence, in reſpect of which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156636:110"/> when they come to repent; they ſhall returne, and ſay, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Truely in vaine is ſalvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitudes of mountaines, anſwerable unto which are the great temples built unto falſe Gods they ſhall flee away: In the new Jeruſalem, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22. there was no Temple ſeene, no Temple conſecrated to this or that Saint ſhall be found therein.</p>
            <p>What are the Iſlands? They are grounds ſeparated from the earth, by the Sea: The Sea is the corruption of Religion, upon which the ſecond Viall was poured. Therefore ſuch places as are conſecrated by Popiſh Devotions, as Church yards, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popiſh grounds, they are theſe Iſlands, that ſhall flee away; you ſhall no more heare tell of conſecrated Church-yard, or any ſuch matter all the world over. Then will fall to the ground all your Cathedrall Churches, and all thoſe high Places that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toppe the people of God, and hinder the growth of the things of God neere about them, though thoſe things that be ſuperſtitiouſly ſet apart for holy ends be never ſo glorious, they ſhall be all ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and vaniſh away, there will be no more noiſe of them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>And upon men there fell a great haile out of heaven</hi>] The Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by ſome, is thought to be unto the hayle ſpoken of <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.11. which the Lord caſt downe from heaven upon the Cananites, ſo that mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e died with haileſtones, then they which the children of Iſrael ſlew with the Sword: but I cannot ſay, that haile ſtorme is here alluded unto: for here men did not die upon it, but blaſphemed onely; unleſſe it ſhould be ſpoken of their everlaſting death in hell, but that were a common judgement to all the wicked: but I rather thinke it is an alluſion to the haile ſtorme in, Aegypt, whereof the effect was, that they ſinned, and hardened their hearts yet more, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.34. Well then, if it be ſuch an hayle as doth not kill men, but provoke them to blaſpheme, what kinde of judgement might it be? Interpreters doe not tell us: So that we can take no better courſe to know it, then to ſee what allegoricall haile ſtones meane in Scripture, for by comparing Scriptures together, you ſhall have the full meaning of every part of Gods Counſell. For this end let us look in <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.17. where the Prophet telleth us that the haile ſhall ſweep away the refuge of lies, when once Chriſt is laid in the foundation, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. then all the reſt of the refuges of the ſons of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:156636:111"/> men, that are lying refuges, ſhall be ſwept away: There is alſo another alluſion ſuting hereunto in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.11.13. where the Lord threateneth againſt the wall that is dawbed with untempered morter: there ſhall be an over-flowing ſhower, and ye O great haile ſtones ſhall fall, and a ſtormy winde ſhall rent it. So then, this kinde of haile ſtorme is ſuch a plague of God upon men as ſhall deſtroy all their lying refuges, and men ſhall then inſult over them, and ſay, where is the dawbing wherewith you have dawbed it? So then, at this time the Lord will ſend an haile ſtorme that ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all the counterfeit Religions in the world, all the juggelings of their Miracles, all the faire ſeeming pretences of Popery, or any other Religion, all their doctrines of merits, and confidences in their prayers to Saints, and Angels, and ſuperſtitious Devotions, an haile ſtorme ſhall fall upon them all in ſuch ſort, that you ſhall ſee the vanity of them: And all the world ſhall ſee, that all Relgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beſides Chriſtianity, are but a refuge of lies, and in the end their jugglelings, and ſophiſtry ſhall be blowne up, and blaſted: Some ſhall be ſhaken out of them, &amp; ſetled upon better bottoms, &amp; others will be provoked to blaſpheme, they will ſo vex themſelves with extremity of anguiſh, for that they are thus bereaved of their old comfortable good dayes; and oh the joyfull feſtivals that they were wont for to keep in their Abbies, and ſuperſtitious places, for the loſſe of which they ſhall blaſpheme the Lord, and true Religion, and all the inſtruments of the Goſpels propagation. Such a thing as this we reade of <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. When as the ſeventh Angel ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there were great voices in heaven, ſaying, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of this world are become the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, &amp;c.

For thus you ſee it is evidently here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Text. The ſeventh Angel did poure out his Vial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Antichriſtian ayre, and that was ſuch an ayre as was darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſmoake of the bottomleſſe pit, as with a foggy miſt: Now when this ayre ſhall againe bee cleared, and the foggy dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof diſpelled, ſo that men may have the true uſe of it, to ſee through it thoſe heavenly bodies which were darkened by that ſmoake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.2. then ſhall men ſee Jeſus Chriſt to be all in all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Juſtification, Sanctification, Conſolation, which in Popery you could not: then ſhall the true Church be ſeen, which like the Moon, borroweth all the light it hath from the Sun: (true indeed if the Moone be taken for the world, then ſhe treadeth it under her feet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1.) In Popery you could not ſee what a true Church was, they will tell you of this and that Church, but they are no true Churches. But when this vaile ſhall be removed, then ſhall you clearely know that the true Church is not a Catholike viſible, nor a Cathedrall, nor a Dioceſan, nor a Provinciall Church. Then ſhall you ſee the Stars of heaven, you ſhall know who are the true offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church, not Paratours, and Proctours, Deacons, and Archdeacons, Biſhops, and Archbiſhops over many Churches, they are not the lights which the Lord hath ſet therein: And you ſhall then ſee who were the true members of the Church, Not the Canonized Saints, not ſuch as Saint <hi>George,</hi> who was an ancient Heretick, but you ſhall ſee them to be ſuch as are ſpoken of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. blameleſſe, and harmleſſe, the Sons of God, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, ſhining as lights in the world; then ſhall you ſee the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more clearely, true doctrine, and worſhip, and government as it is held forth in the Goſpell of Chriſt, and when you ſhall ſee theſe things, then, It is done; Even all that God hath to do in the world, for any further Reformation expect it not, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. when the time is come that the ſeventh Angel hath blowne his Trumpet, the

Firſt, from the manner of the entrance of this heavenly glory into the hearts of men, whether it come into private perſons, or publique States; It commeth terribly with lightnings and thunderings, the which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from God, doe ſo terrifie the hearts of men, and the ſtate of the world, that they ſhall ſee plainely how they have beene deluded with deſperate follyes, and when men are put unto ſuch an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in their ſpirits; this will be the point they come unto: <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we doe to be ſaved?</hi> as did the Jaylor when he had been ſoundly ſhaken with the earthquake, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.26.30. and ſo it will be with Kingdomes, when God hath in like ſort ſhaken them, they will contend for true Religion, and will not then be baffled out and deluded with vanities, as now they be: when the ſpirits of men are terrified, and they feele no ſalvation in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they know not what ſhall become of their precious ſoules, this will ſet all the world on worke to looke about them: for upon this ground you ſhall ſee Indians, and Jews, and Pagans gaping
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:156636:112"/> after ſalvation, when they ſee by theſe terrible ſtormes, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that all their Religions are but ſo many refuges of lies, then is there worke in hand indeed, which when God hath begun hee will alſo finiſh it unto the day of Chriſt, and it will be ſuch an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, as was never heard of in the world: Heretofore ſo long as this worke was found among poore Chriſtians, the great Lords of the world perſecuted them, and deviſed all manner of cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for them: but when they felt that the wrath of God was kindled againſt them, then their hearts fell, and they were all in a combuſtion for the ſtate of their ſoules before the Lord: now they were glad to renounce their <hi>Jupiters,</hi> and <hi>Junoes,</hi> and to embrace Chriſtianity, and to hearken to a better Covenant, this is the effect of thunderings and lightnings, and voyces it ſoone blaſteth Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and forceth man to ſeeke after a clearer paſſage to heaven.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon is taken from the power of the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> of Chriſt to diſpell this Popiſh ignorance, and to carry an end the heart of a man with ſuch power, that he can no longer lie at quiet in his naturall eſtate; but it worketh in men theſe foure ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſubdueth and tameth the hearts of men that now they will joyn themſelves unto the people of God, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11.6.7, 8. the Wolfe ſhall lie with the Lambe, the Leopard ſhall lie downe with the Kid, &amp;c. So great is their change in their hearts, that mens Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous tyrannies are taken away, and there is wrought in them, a kindly ſweete unſhaken frame, that will ſo breake forth againſt Gods people as formerly; thus doth the earthquake ſhake out droſſe, and corruptions, and eſtabliſh the heart in a ſweete graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frame of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, The knowledge of Chriſt will breed diviſion, as well as conjunction; <hi>Thinke you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that I am come to ſend p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this diviſion is made in Cities, and in Kingdomes, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.4. The city was divided, and part held with the Apoſtles, and part held with the Jewes: ſo it is in the Text, the great city was divided into three parts, ſome are hardened in their ignorance, and ſome are drawne out of it, and a third part will ſtand Neuters betweene
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:156636:113"/> both to ſee, which way the ballance will turne, and theſe are alſo hardened in their blindneſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt hath in it this power to cauſe men to riſe up in armes againſt all the enemies of the Goſpell of Chriſt in a lawfull way of God: There is a power in true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. A fourth power of this knowledge, is to blow up all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men in the worſhip of God, wherby men have deluded themſelves and others; when once mens hearts are lifted up in the waves of the Lord, as it is ſaid of <hi>Johoſhaphat</hi> that his heart was, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.6. and then he tooke away the High places, and groves out of <hi>Judah:</hi> So when the zeale of God lifteth up the hearts of his people, then will they not endure a conſecrated place in all the world where they come. And when this Viall is poured out, the earth ſhall be full of this knowledge of God, and then all the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of Eaſe, and Churches of ſtate, and Temples of glory, whereby the world hath beene deluded, they will not leave them a ſtone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtone that ſhall not be throwne downe: This is the ſecond Reaſon, taken from the power of ſaving knowledge, which ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mens wilde natures, worketh holy diviſion, giveth courage, and the power of zeale againſt all ſuperſtitions, and inventions of men, though now in ſome places you may not paſſe through with a burden, nor looke upon the wall thereof: The zeale of the Lord of hoaſt will blow them up, thoſe places will be laid open to the reſt of the ſtreetes, and become but common ſoyle, they will not then be regarded but trampled upon.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> The Third Reaſon is from the juſt judgement of God upon all that are not effectually wrought upon by this ſaving knowledge of God, if men come not in on ſome meaſure to a perfect accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods worke in their hearts, there will fall ſuch a plague of haile upon them, as will teare away their vaile, and rend away their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:156636:113"/> hypocriticall ſhifts, and goodly pretences, and waſh down their untempered dawbings, wherewith they have dawbed the walls of their ſtanding in the Church of God: He will ſo rend them to pieces, that if they will not come in, he will leave them to ſuch open blaſphemies, that you ſhall clearely ſee there is no more hope of their converſion, nor ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of this point in the firſt place, may ſerve to teach <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> you a juſt reproofe of the Popiſh conceit, That ignorance is the mother of Devotion, unleſſe they meane it of their owne devotion; True, it is the mother of their devotion indeed: ſo long as their people are hood-winked with it, they will thinke they doe God good ſervice, if they be in the Church, though they underſtand nothing there, and if when they die, they be buryed in a Church-yard, they thinke they are the better, and yet better if they be buryed in a Church, and yet better, if it be in a Chancell, and better then ſo, if it be under the Altar, and better then that, if a Fryars Cowle be wrapped about them. This is indeed the mother of whippings, and ſcourgings of auricular confeſſions, and of all Popiſh ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for in truth, take away this ignorance, and all Popiſh devotion doth of it ſelfe fall to the ground, if once this vaile be removed from the face of all Nations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Learne from hence to ſee what great need wee <label type="milestone">

God be mercifull to us, and bleſſe us, and cauſe his face to ſhine upon us: And for what end? That thy way may be known upon earth, and thy ſaving truth among all Nations. And when once the light of the Goſpell is diſperſed, it will bring in all Nations, it will thunder upon them, and never leave untill it have changed them. If this knowledge of God come amongſt an army of men, they will not touch any thing that is their brethrens, not meddle, not make with any to doe them harme, no mans purſe ſhall be taken from him, no mans goods taken away without due recompence, only they will not be deluded with ſhaddowes, nor ſuffer mountaines to overtop them, neither
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156636:114"/> will they be encompaſſed with hands: they will raiſe ſuch an earthquake firſt, in Church, and Common-wealth, as you will at length wonder at, for though it begin in a corner of the world, it will not ceaſe till it have ſhaken all Chriſtendome, for when men once begin clearely to ſee which is the true Church of God, that it is not Cathedrall, nor Provinciall, nor Dioceſan, but congregationall only, the officers whereof are godly Paſtors, and Teachers, and ruling Elders, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. And when they ſee that the Saints which they have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and eſteemed, are not the true Saints of God, nor theſe the Churches, nor thoſe the officers of Chriſt wherewith they have been gulled: but they ſee now who are the Saints of the moſt high; and can put a difference now between pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and vile: In this way men will goe on to raiſe ſuch an earthquake (and that not beſides the Law neither) that if any City riſe up againſt them, fall it muſt, and ſtoop unto them, and at length Rome it ſelfe ſhall fall, and all the Cities of the Nations that cleave unto her, and every mountaine ſhall bee rooted up, and all their conſecrated places ſhall lie levell with the common ſoile, this will the Lord bring to paſſe, and will not leave till he hath wrought his great work in the world, this is his revealed will, and it will not faile untill every jot and tittle of it be fulfilled. Let us therefore pray both night and day, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon for our brethren in our native countrey, for whom God hath wrought all theſe great things, and for whom greater things yet remain to be done, for whom our work is to wraſtle with God, that they may not periſh for lack of knowledge, nor miſtake a falſe Church for a true, (and falſe it is, if it be either Cathedrall, Provinciall, Nationall, or Dioceſan) But pray we, that they may ſee the Moone, which God hath ſet in the Firmament, even the true forme of a Church of the new Teſtament. And alſo that Chriſt may bee better known in all the parts of his Kingly office, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Church, that they may ſee who are Papiſts, and who are the true Saints of God, and who are counterfeit, that they diſcerne between cleane and uncleane: for if the ſaving knowledge of God grow up unto any ripeneſſe among them, it will not beare many things that are there remaining, many

Truely in the eyes of men it is wonderfull. But you know the leaſt thing you caſt into a ſtreame, will runne downe the ſtreame, you neede not force it; you have caſt it in where nature hath ſet a courſe to carry it along: And how much more ſhall things runne an end, when the God of nature hath ſet them a courſe? when he powreth a Vial upon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and darkneſſe of Popiſh ſuperſtition, then great workes therein, will be done, for now a man underworkes the Lord, when he doth what his word hath ſpoken, and what his hand hath gone before us in: And when the ordinances of God ſay,
